## 🚨 THE ONE THING YOU NEED TO DO

### Fix Token Permission (2 Minutes)

**Your Current Status**:
```
✅ READ permission: Working
❌ CREATE permission: Missing
```

### Step-by-Step Fix

1. **Go to Sanity Console**
   - URL: https://manage.sanity.io
   - Login with your account

2. **Select Your Project**
   - Project ID: `ept6x5im`
   - Project Name: "Precision Manufacturing"

3. **Navigate to Tokens**
   - Click "Settings" in left sidebar
   - Click "API & Webhooks"
   - Click "Tokens"

4. **Edit Your Token**
   - Find token starting with: `skqGXNV9...`
   - Click the three-dot menu (⋮)
   - Click "Edit"

5. **Enable "Create" Permission**
   - Check: ✓ Create
   - Check: ✓ Read
   - Check: ✓ Update
   - Check: ✓ Delete
   - Click "Save"

6. **Copy New Token**
   - Click "Copy" to copy the full token
   - Open `.env.local`
   - Find the `SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN=` line
   - Replace with your new token

7. **Restart Dev Server**
   ```bash
   pkill -f "next dev"
   sleep 1
   npm run dev
   ```

**That's it!** Once token is updated, everything else executes automatically.

### Verify Token Fix
```bash
set -a && source .env.local && set +a
node scripts/verify-token-permissions.mjs
```

Should show:
```
✅ READ permission: Working
✅ CREATE permission: Working
✅ UPDATE permission: Working
✅ DELETE permission: Working
```
