   - Maintain clean tooling, avoid cross-contamination

2. **Annealing Temperature:**
   - C11000: Anneal at 700-1200°F (371-649°C) - conductivity maintained
   - Over-annealing (>1300°F) can cause grain growth, slight conductivity loss
   - Rapid cooling vs. slow cooling: Minimal impact on conductivity

3. **Surface Condition:**
   - Oxide layer has lower conductivity than base metal
   - Pickling or bright dipping restores surface conductivity
   - Plating (tin, nickel, silver) affects surface conductivity

### Coolant and Lubrication for Copper

**Coolant Selection:**

| Alloy Type | Recommended Coolant | Concentration | Benefits |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Pure Copper** | Sulfurized oil or semi-synthetic | 10:1 to 20:1 | Prevents galling, improves finish |
| **Brass** | Soluble oil or synthetic | 20:1 to 40:1 | Chip evacuation, cooling |
| **Bronze** | Soluble oil | 15:1 to 30:1 | Lubrication for harder alloys |
| **Beryllium Copper** | Semi-synthetic with mist suppression | 15:1 to 25:1 | Dust control (safety critical) |

**Note on BeCu Coolant:** Use wet machining exclusively to minimize airborne beryllium dust. Ensure coolant system has fine filtration to prevent beryllium accumulation.

## Annealing and Stress Relief

### Annealing Temperatures and Procedures

**Annealing Parameters for Common Copper Alloys:**

| Alloy | Annealing Temperature | Soak Time | Cooling | Result | Grain Size |
|-------|----------------------|-----------|---------|--------|------------|
| **C11000 Copper** | 700-1200°F (371-649°C) | 30-120 min | Air or water | Fully soft, 32 KSI tensile | Medium |
| **C26000 Cartridge Brass** | 800-1100°F (427-593°C) | 30-90 min | Air or water | Fully soft, 46 KSI tensile | Medium |
| **C36000 Free-Cut Brass** | 850-1050°F (454-566°C) | 30-60 min | Air | Soft, machinable | Medium |
| **C51000 Phosphor Bronze** | 800-1200°F (427-649°C) | 30-120 min | Air | Soft, formable | Medium to coarse |
| **C95400 Aluminum Bronze** | 1150-1250°F (621-677°C) | 2-4 hours | Slow cool or air | Homogenized structure | Fine |
| **C17200 BeCu (Solution Anneal)** | 1450-1475°F (788-802°C) | 15-60 min | Water <10 sec | Soft for forming | Fine |

**Stress Relief (Low Temperature Annealing):**

| Alloy | Stress Relief Temp | Time | Purpose | Properties Change |
|-------|-------------------|------|---------|-------------------|
| **C11000 Copper** | 300-500°F (149-260°C) | 1-2 hours | Dimensional stability | Minimal strength change |
| **Brass Alloys** | 400-600°F (204-316°C) | 1-3 hours | Prevent season cracking | Slight strength reduction |
| **Phosphor Bronze** | 350-500°F (177-260°C) | 1-2 hours | Spring relaxation control | Minimal change |
| **C17200 BeCu** | 600-650°F (315-343°C) | 2-3 hours | **Aging** (increases hardness!) | Hardness 36-43 HRC |

**Important Notes:**
- **Atmosphere:** Inert or reducing atmosphere prevents oxidation (nitrogen or forming gas)
- **Bright Annealing:** Use 5-10% hydrogen in nitrogen for oxide-free surface
- **Cooling Rate:** Rapid quench for copper (prevents grain growth), air cool for brass/bronze
- **Dezincification Prevention:** For brass in corrosive service, use inhibited alloys (C27400)

### Impact on Machinability

**Machinability vs. Temper Condition:**

| Alloy | Soft (Annealed) | Half Hard | Hard (Cold Worked) | Best for Machining |
|-------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **C11000 Copper** | Poor (20%) | Fair (30%) | Better (30%) | Half hard to hard |
| **C26000 Brass** | Poor (30%) | Good (40%) | Good (50%) | Hard (best chips) |
| **C36000 Free-Cut** | Excellent (90%) | Excellent (100%) | Excellent (100%) | Any temper |
| **C95400 Al Bronze** | Poor (30%) | Good (50%) | Good (60%) | Hard or as-cast |
| **C17200 BeCu** | Poor (60%) | N/A | Excellent (80%) | Aged condition best |

**General Rule:** Most copper alloys machine better in harder conditions (except pure copper which is always difficult). The increased strength reduces gumminess and improves chip breaking.

## Conclusion

Copper and copper alloy machining requires careful material selection, appropriate cutting parameters, and awareness of unique challenges like work hardening, chip control, and tarnish prevention. Success depends on understanding:

- **Alloy Selection:** Match electrical/thermal conductivity requirements with mechanical properties and machinability
- **Machinability Optimization:** C36000 free-cutting brass defines 100% rating; pure copper is challenging at 20%
- **Electrical Conductivity:** Pure copper (C11000) provides 100% IACS; alloying reduces conductivity significantly
- **Heat Treatment:** Annealing softens for forming; aging beryllium copper achieves 175-200 KSI tensile strength

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **C36000 Free-Cutting Brass** is the easiest copper alloy to machine (100% machinability rating, excellent chips)

4. **C95400 Aluminum Bronze** provides superior seawater corrosion resistance but is difficult to machine (50% rating)
5. **Machine Copper at High Speeds:** 400-1000 SFM minimizes work hardening and built-up edge
6. **Annealing Temperatures:** 700-1200°F for copper, 800-1100°F for brass, 1450-1475°F for BeCu solution treatment
