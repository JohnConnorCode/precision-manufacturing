## Aluminum Alloy Classification System

### Understanding the Numbering System

The Aluminum Association uses a four-digit system to identify wrought aluminum alloys:

**First Digit - Major Alloying Element:**

| Series | Primary Alloying Element | Key Characteristics | Common Applications |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **1xxx** | 99.00%+ Pure Aluminum | Excellent corrosion resistance, low strength | Electrical conductors, chemical equipment |
| **2xxx** | Copper | High strength, poor corrosion resistance | Aerospace structures, high-stress components |
| **3xxx** | Manganese | Good formability, moderate strength | Food/beverage packaging, heat exchangers |
| **4xxx** | Silicon | Lower melting point, good fluidity | Welding wire, brazing applications |
| **5xxx** | Magnesium | Excellent corrosion resistance, weldable | Marine applications, pressure vessels |
| **6xxx** | Magnesium & Silicon | Heat treatable, good corrosion resistance | General purpose, extrusions, structures |
| **7xxx** | Zinc | Highest strength aluminum alloys | Aerospace, high-stress structural parts |
| **8xxx** | Other Elements | Lithium, tin, or other | Specialized aerospace applications |

**Second Digit - Modification:**
- 0 = Original alloy
- 1-9 = Alloy modification (controls impurity limits or adds elements)

**Third & Fourth Digits:**
- For 1xxx series: Indicate purity level (1100 = 99.00% minimum aluminum)
- For 2xxx-8xxx: Identify specific alloys within the series

### Temper Designation System

The temper designation follows the alloy number (e.g., 6061-T6) and indicates the material's heat treatment and mechanical properties:

**Common Temper Designations:**

| Temper | Process | Characteristics | Machinability | Typical Applications |
|--------|---------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **-F** | As Fabricated | No special control of properties | Varies | Not typically machined |
| **-O** | Annealed | Softest condition, best formability | Gummy, poor finish | Forming operations, then heat treated |
| **-T3** | Solution heat treated, cold worked | Medium strength | Good | Sheet metal parts |
| **-T4** | Solution heat treated, naturally aged | Good strength, good formability | Very good | General machining |
| **-T6** | Solution heat treated, artificially aged | Highest strength for most alloys | Excellent | Precision machined components |
| **-T7** | Solution treated, over-aged | Lower strength, better corrosion resistance | Excellent | Corrosive environments |
| **-T9** | Solution treated, aged, cold worked | Very high strength | Good to excellent | High-stress aerospace parts |

## Heat Treatment of Aluminum Alloys

### Solution Heat Treatment Process

**Process Steps:**

1. **Heating:** Raise temperature to 900-1000°F (482-538°C) depending on alloy
2. **Soaking:** Hold at temperature for 1-3 hours to dissolve alloying elements
3. **Quenching:** Rapid cooling in water (within 10-15 seconds critical)
4. **Aging:** Natural (T4) or artificial (T6) aging to develop strength

**Solution Heat Treatment Temperatures:**

| Alloy | Solution Temperature | Quench Method | Critical Quench Time |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| **2024** | 910-930°F (488-499°C) | Cold water | <15 seconds |
| **6061** | 970-990°F (521-532°C) | Cold water or glycol | <20 seconds |
| **7075** | 860-880°F (460-471°C) | Cold water | <10 seconds (critical!) |

### Aging Processes

**Natural Aging (T4 Temper):**
- Occurs at room temperature over 4-5 days
- Reaches 90% of full strength in 24-48 hours
- Good formability maintained
- Typical for 2024-T4 sheet and plate

**Artificial Aging (T6 Temper):**
- Controlled heating to 250-400°F (121-204°C)
- Hold time: 8-24 hours depending on alloy
- Develops maximum strength
- Most common for machined components

**Artificial Aging Parameters:**

| Alloy | Aging Temperature | Aging Time | Result |
|-------|------------------|------------|--------|
| **6061-T6** | 350°F (177°C) | 8-10 hours | 40 KSI yield strength |
| **7075-T6** | 250°F (121°C) | 24 hours | 73 KSI yield strength |
| **7075-T73** | 250°F + 350°F (two-step) | 8 hrs + 8 hrs | 63 KSI yield (improved corrosion resistance) |

### Impact on Machinability

**Machining in Different Tempers:**

| Temper | Machinability | Tool Life | Surface Finish | Dimensional Stability |
|--------|---------------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| **-O (Annealed)** | Poor (gummy) | Low (material builds up) | Poor (tearing) | Poor (work hardens) |
| **-T4 (Solution treated)** | Good | Good | Very good | Good |
| **-T6 (Fully aged)** | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |
| **-T7 (Over-aged)** | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |

**Best Practice:** Machine in T6 or T651 (stress-relieved) condition for optimal results. T651 material is preferred for close-tolerance work due to stress relief.

**Example: High-Speed Machining of 6061-T6 with 0.500" 3-Flute Carbide End Mill:**

```
Surface Speed: 2000 SFM (aggressive high-speed)
RPM = (2000 × 3.82) / 0.500 = 15,280 RPM

Chip Load: 0.010" per tooth
Feed Rate = 15,280 × 3 × 0.010 = 458 IPM

Radial Depth: 50% of diameter = 0.250"
Axial Depth: 0.300" (60% of diameter)

Material Removal Rate = 0.250 × 0.300 × 458 = 34.4 cubic inches per minute
Cycle time for 10 cubic inch pocket = 10 / 34.4 = 0.29 min (17 seconds!)
```

### Challenge 2: Burrs on Edges

**Symptoms:**
- Excessive burrs requiring manual deburring
- Inconsistent burr formation
- Sharp edges that fail inspection

**Root Causes:**

### Challenge 3: Dimensional Variation in Production

**Symptoms:**
- First parts good, later parts out of tolerance
- Part-to-part dimensional variation
- Cannot hold specified tolerances consistently

**Root Causes:**

| **Thermal Compensation** | Use machine thermal compensation features | ±0.0001-0.0003" improvement |

### Challenge 4: Galling in Threaded Features

**Symptoms:**
- Aluminum-to-aluminum threaded joints seize
- Thread damage during assembly/disassembly
- Inconsistent torque values

**Root Causes:**
- Aluminum's tendency to cold weld
