# Adaptive Machining Technology: The Future of Precision Manufacturing

## Introduction

Adaptive machining represents a paradigm shift in manufacturing, where machines respond intelligently to real-world variations in materials, tools, and processes. Unlike traditional fixed-program machining, adaptive systems continuously monitor and adjust parameters to maintain optimal performance.

At IIS, we've pioneered adaptive machining implementations that have reduced scrap rates by 75%, improved first-pass yield to 99.7%, and enabled manufacturing of components previously considered impossible to produce consistently.
