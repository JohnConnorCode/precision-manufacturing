# Wire EDM and Sinker EDM: Precision Machining Complete Guide

## Executive Summary

Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) represents a revolutionary approach to precision manufacturing, using controlled electrical sparks to remove material from conductive workpieces. Unlike conventional machining that relies on mechanical cutting forces, EDM machines any electrically conductive material regardless of hardness, enabling complex geometries with exceptional precision and superior surface integrity.

**Key Advantages of EDM Technology:**

- **Hardness Independent:** Machine fully hardened materials (60+ HRC) without tool wear concerns
- **Exceptional Precision:** Tolerances to ±0.00004" (±0.001 mm) achievable with Wire EDM
- **Zero Mechanical Force:** No cutting forces, enabling ultra-thin walls and delicate features
- **Complex Geometry Capability:** Sharp internal corners, intricate contours, and tapered walls
- **Superior Surface Integrity:** Minimal residual stress, recast layer control for critical applications
- **Burr-Free Machining:** Parts come off machine requiring minimal secondary operations

## Understanding EDM Technology

### How EDM Works

EDM removes material through a series of controlled electrical discharges (sparks) between an electrode and the workpiece, both submerged in dielectric fluid:

**The EDM Process Sequence:**

1. **Spark Generation:** Voltage applied between electrode and workpiece (typically 80-300V)
2. **Dielectric Breakdown:** Dielectric fluid ionizes, creating conductive plasma channel
3. **Material Removal:** Temperature reaches 8,000-12,000°C, vaporizing material
4. **Flushing:** Dielectric fluid flushes away debris and cools the surface
5. **Repeat:** Process repeats 20,000-250,000 times per second

**Critical Process Parameters:**

| Parameter | Typical Range | Effect on Process |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Pulse Duration** | 0.1-500 microseconds | Longer = faster cutting, rougher finish |
| **Current** | 0.1-40 amperes | Higher = faster cutting, larger recast layer |
| **Voltage** | 80-300 volts | Affects spark gap and stability |
| **Wire/Electrode Feed Rate** | 0.002-0.400 in/min | Balanced with removal rate |
| **Dielectric Type** | Deionized water (Wire), Oil (Sinker) | Affects flushing and surface finish |

## Wire EDM Technology

### Process Overview

Wire EDM uses a continuously moving brass, zinc-coated brass, or molybdenum wire (0.002-0.012" diameter) as the cutting electrode. The wire never touches the workpiece; material is removed through electrical discharges across a small gap (0.0004-0.0015").

**Wire EDM Capabilities:**

- **Maximum Workpiece Thickness:** Up to 12" typical, 16-20" on specialized machines
- **Minimum Feature Size:** Down to 0.0025" radius (wire diameter + spark gap)
- **Taper Capability:** Up to ±30° from vertical on modern 4-axis machines
- **Cutting Speed:** 0.5-15 sq.in./hour depending on material thickness and finish requirements
- **Accuracy:** ±0.00008" (±0.002 mm) with climate control and proper setup

### Wire Types and Applications

**Surface Finish Capabilities:**

Wire EDM uses multiple cutting passes to achieve desired surface finish:

| Pass Type | Purpose | Typical Ra | Cutting Speed | Power Settings |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Rough Pass** | Material removal | 125-250 μin (3.2-6.4 μm) | 6-15 sq.in./hr | High current (20-40A) |
| **Semi-Finish Pass** | Improve geometry | 63-90 μin (1.6-2.3 μm) | 3-8 sq.in./hr | Medium current (5-15A) |
| **Finish Pass 1** | Final sizing | 32-50 μin (0.8-1.3 μm) | 1-4 sq.in./hr | Low current (1-5A) |
| **Finish Pass 2** | Surface quality | 16-32 μin (0.4-0.8 μm) | 0.5-2 sq.in./hr | Very low current (<2A) |
| **Super Finish (optional)** | Mirror finish | 8-16 μin (0.2-0.4 μm) | 0.3-1 sq.in./hr | Ultra-low settings |

**Note:** Each additional finish pass adds approximately 25-40% to total cutting time but significantly improves surface quality and dimensional accuracy.

## Surface Integrity and Recast Layer

### Understanding Recast Layer

EDM creates a thin "recast" or "white" layer on the machined surface where molten material resolidifies. This layer has different properties than the base material:

**Recast Layer Characteristics:**

| Material | Typical Recast Thickness | Microhardness Change | Microcracking Risk |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Aluminum Alloys** | 0.0001-0.0003" (2.5-7.6 μm) | Minimal change | Very low |
| **Tool Steels** | 0.0003-0.0008" (7.6-20 μm) | +20-40% harder than base | Moderate |
| **Stainless Steels** | 0.0002-0.0006" (5-15 μm) | +10-30% harder | Low-moderate |
| **Titanium Alloys** | 0.0002-0.0005" (5-13 μm) | +15-25% harder | Low |
| **Inconel/Superalloys** | 0.0004-0.001" (10-25 μm) | +30-50% harder | Moderate-high |
| **Carbides** | 0.0001-0.0004" (2.5-10 μm) | Minimal (already hard) | Low |

### Recast Layer Management

**For Critical Aerospace Applications:**

1. **Minimize Recast Formation:**
   - Use low-energy finish passes (reduces recast to <0.0002")
   - Multiple finish passes with decreasing energy
   - Optimize dielectric flushing to minimize heat affected zone

2. **Remove Recast Layer:**
   - Light abrasive blasting (glass bead, ceramic media)
   - Chemical etching (controlled acid treatment)
   - Electropolishing (removes 0.0002-0.0005")
   - Manual polishing for accessible surfaces

3. **Stress Relief:**
   - Post-EDM stress relief: 900-1100°F for 2-4 hours (material dependent)
   - Reduces residual tensile stresses in recast layer
   - Essential for fatigue-critical components

**Aerospace Requirement Example:**
Many aerospace specifications (AMS, customer specs) require recast layer removal or strict control:
- Turbine engine components: Recast layer <0.0002" or complete removal
- Fatigue-critical parts: Stress relief mandatory after EDM
- Inspection: Metallurgical cross-sections to verify compliance
