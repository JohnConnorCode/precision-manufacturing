## Laser Cutting Technology Overview

### Fundamental Laser Cutting Process

**How Laser Cutting Works:**

1. **Laser Generation:** High-energy laser beam generated by CO2 gas mixture or fiber optic system
2. **Beam Delivery:** Beam directed through mirrors (CO2) or fiber optic cable (fiber laser) to cutting head
3. **Focusing:** Lens focuses beam to small spot size (0.004-0.010" diameter)
4. **Material Interaction:** Focused beam heats material to melting or vaporization temperature
5. **Material Removal:** High-pressure assist gas blows molten material through kerf
6. **Motion Control:** CNC system moves cutting head or material to create programmed geometry

**Key Process Parameters:**
- **Laser Power:** 1-30 kW (higher power = thicker material capability, faster cutting)
- **Cutting Speed:** 50-2000 IPM depending on material and thickness
- **Assist Gas Pressure:** 10-350 PSI (varies by material and process)
- **Focal Position:** -0.050" to +0.050" relative to material surface
- **Nozzle Standoff:** 0.040-0.080" from material surface

## Cut Quality and Edge Characteristics

### Kerf Width Analysis

**Kerf Width by Technology and Material:**

| Material/Thickness | CO2 Laser Kerf | Fiber Laser Kerf | Impact on Part Accuracy |
|-------------------|----------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Mild Steel 0.060"** | 0.010-0.012" | 0.008-0.010" | Program offset = kerf/2 (0.004-0.005") |
| **Mild Steel 0.250"** | 0.012-0.015" | 0.010-0.012" | Tighter tolerances with fiber |
| **Stainless 0.060"** | 0.010-0.012" | 0.008-0.010" | Consistent across both technologies |
| **Stainless 0.250"** | 0.014-0.017" | 0.012-0.014" | Narrower kerf = less material waste |
| **Aluminum 0.060"** | 0.012-0.015" | 0.010-0.012" | Thermal conductivity widens kerf |
| **Aluminum 0.250"** | 0.016-0.020" | 0.014-0.016" | Widest kerf of common materials |

**Kerf Width Factors:**
- **Material thickness:** Thicker material = wider kerf (beam divergence through material)
- **Laser power:** Higher power = slightly wider kerf (larger melt pool)
- **Cutting speed:** Faster speed = narrower kerf (less heat input)
- **Focal position:** Affects kerf taper and width
- **Nozzle diameter:** Larger nozzle = wider kerf

**Kerf Compensation in Programming:**
- **Inside features (holes):** Add kerf/2 to programmed dimension (kerf makes holes smaller)
- **Outside features (part outline):** Subtract kerf/2 from programmed dimension (kerf makes parts smaller)
- **CAM software:** Automatic kerf compensation based on measured values
- **Verification:** First article inspection confirms compensation accuracy

### Surface Finish and Edge Quality

**Surface Roughness Comparison:**

| Material | Thickness | CO2 Edge Finish | Fiber Edge Finish | Measurement |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Mild Steel (O2 cut)** | 0.105" | Ra 150-200 μin | Ra 120-180 μin | Slight oxidation normal |
| **Mild Steel (O2 cut)** | 0.500" | Ra 200-280 μin | Ra 180-250 μin | Rougher with thickness |
| **Stainless (N2 cut)** | 0.105" | Ra 100-150 μin | Ra 80-120 μin | Bright, clean edge |
| **Stainless (N2 cut)** | 0.375" | Ra 150-220 μin | Ra 120-180 μin | Excellent quality |
| **Aluminum (N2 cut)** | 0.105" | Ra 120-180 μin | Ra 100-140 μin | Good edge quality |
| **Aluminum (N2 cut)** | 0.375" | Ra 180-260 μin | Ra 140-200 μin | Some striations normal |

**Edge Quality Factors:**

| Factor | Impact on Edge Quality | Optimization Strategy |
|--------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **Cutting Speed** | Too fast = rough edge, dross; too slow = excessive HAZ | Optimize for material/thickness |
| **Assist Gas Pressure** | Too low = incomplete ejection, dross; too high = turbulence, rough edge | Adjust by thickness and material |
| **Focal Position** | Incorrect = poor energy distribution, tapered kerf | Calibrate regularly, adjust by application |
| **Nozzle Condition** | Damaged nozzle = poor gas flow, inconsistent cuts | Inspect and replace frequently |
| **Material Quality** | Contamination, scale, oil = poor edge, spatter | Use clean, scale-free material |
| **Machine Condition** | Worn optics, misalignment = degraded beam quality | Preventive maintenance schedule |

**Edge Quality Classification:**

- **Class 1 (Excellent):** Ra <125 μin, no dross, minimal HAZ, square edge - acceptable for most applications without secondary finishing
- **Class 2 (Good):** Ra 125-200 μin, light dross easily removed, moderate HAZ - acceptable for non-critical applications
- **Class 3 (Fair):** Ra 200-300 μin, significant dross, large HAZ - may require deburring or grinding
- **Class 4 (Poor):** Ra >300 μin, heavy dross, excessive HAZ, tapered kerf - unacceptable, process optimization required

For edge finishing requirements, see our [Deburring and Finishing Operations Guide](/resources/deburring-finishing-operations).

### Heat-Affected Zone (HAZ)

**HAZ Width by Material and Process:**

| Material | Thickness | CO2 HAZ | Fiber HAZ | Metallurgical Impact |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Mild Steel** | 0.105" | 0.010-0.015" | 0.008-0.012" | Slight hardening at edge (HRC 35-45) |
| **Mild Steel** | 0.500" | 0.018-0.025" | 0.015-0.020" | Larger HAZ with slower cutting |
| **Stainless 304** | 0.105" | 0.008-0.012" | 0.006-0.010" | Minimal carbide precipitation |
| **Stainless 304** | 0.375" | 0.015-0.022" | 0.012-0.018" | Watch for sensitization in thick materials |
| **Aluminum 6061** | 0.105" | 0.015-0.025" | 0.012-0.020" | Localized annealing (softening) |
| **Aluminum 6061** | 0.375" | 0.025-0.040" | 0.020-0.035" | More pronounced softening |

**HAZ Minimization Strategies:**
- **Higher cutting speeds:** Less time at temperature = smaller HAZ
- **Nitrogen assist gas:** No exothermic reaction (vs. oxygen) = lower heat input
- **Optimal focal position:** Concentrates energy at cut point
- **Pulsed laser mode:** For very thin materials, pulsed mode reduces average heat input
- **Fiber laser advantage:** Faster cutting = inherently smaller HAZ

**HAZ Implications:**
- **Mild steel:** Edge hardening from rapid cooling (typically not problematic)
- **Stainless steel:** Sensitization risk in 304/316 if HAZ >0.020" (carbide precipitation reduces corrosion resistance)
- **Aluminum:** Softening in heat-treatable alloys (6061-T6 becomes T4 condition at edge)
- **High-strength steels:** Hardening can make edge brittle, susceptible to cracking
- **Subsequent welding:** HAZ from laser cutting can affect weld quality

### Dross Formation and Control

**Dross Characteristics:**

Dross is re-solidified molten material that adheres to the bottom edge of laser-cut parts. Amount and adhesion vary by material, thickness, and process parameters.

**Dross Formation by Material:**

| Material | Dross Tendency | Typical Appearance | Removal Difficulty |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Mild Steel (O2)** | Low to Moderate | Small beads on bottom edge | Easy (wire brush or tumbling) |
| **Mild Steel (N2)** | Very Low | Minimal to none | Usually none to remove |
| **Stainless Steel (N2)** | Low | Fine powder-like residue | Very easy (wipe or light brush) |
| **Aluminum** | Moderate | Larger beads, some adhesion | Moderate (scraping or grinding) |
| **Brass** | Moderate to High | Stubborn attachment | Difficult (may require grinding) |
| **Copper** | High | Heavy, tenacious dross | Very difficult (grinding often required) |

**Dross Prevention Strategies:**

| Strategy | Effectiveness | Implementation |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Optimize cutting speed** | High | Find sweet spot - too fast or too slow increases dross |
| **Increase gas pressure** | High | Higher pressure improves melt ejection (watch for turbulence) |
| **Adjust focal position** | Moderate | Lower focal point can improve bottom-edge quality |
| **Use sharper focus** | Moderate | Smaller focal spot concentrates energy |
| **Clean material surface** | Moderate | Remove scale, oil, contamination |
| **Nitrogen vs. oxygen** | High | Nitrogen cutting typically produces less dross |

**Dross Removal Methods:**
- **Wire brushing:** Manual or automated, effective for light dross
- **Tumbling/vibratory finishing:** Batch process, removes light to moderate dross
- **Grinding:** For stubborn dross on critical edges
- **Bead blasting:** Effective but can round edges slightly
- **Chemical cleaning:** For specific materials (brass, copper)

For comprehensive finishing processes, see our [Surface Finishing Treatments Guide](/resources/surface-finishing-treatments-guide).

|----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Simple rectangles** | 60-70% | 75-85% | 85-92% |
| **Mixed geometry** | 50-65% | 70-80% | 80-88% |
| **Complex, irregular shapes** | 40-60% | 65-75% | 75-85% |

**Nesting Strategies:**

| Strategy | Material Savings | Implementation |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Automated nesting software** | 10-20% vs. manual | CAM software with true-shape nesting |
| **Common-line cutting** | 5-10% additional | Share cut lines between adjacent parts |
| **Grain direction consideration** | 2-5% (reduces scrap from grain-sensitive parts) | Orient parts with material grain |
| **Remnant management** | 5-15% (reuse partial sheets) | Track and reuse remnant pieces |
| **Multi-sheet nesting** | 8-15% (optimal across multiple jobs) | Nest multiple jobs together when possible |

**Lead-in/Lead-out Optimization:**
- **Pierce location:** Outside part boundary to avoid pierce mark on finished part
- **Lead-in length:** 0.050-0.150" depending on material thickness
- **Lead-in angle:** Tangent or radial entry to minimize witness mark
- **Sharp corner approach:** Arc entry prevents corner overburn

### Cutting Strategy Optimization

**Cutting Sequence Optimization:**

| Strategy | Benefit | Implementation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Inside-out cutting** | Prevents part distortion | Cut interior features first, then outside profile |
| **Thermal management** | Reduces cumulative distortion | Distribute cutting heat across sheet |
| **Small parts last** | Prevents small part movement | Cut small parts last to maintain sheet stability |
| **Bridge/tab cutting** | Holds parts in skeleton | Add micro-joints, break out after cutting |
| **Part prioritization** | Protects high-value parts | Cut critical/expensive parts first |

**Pierce Strategy:**

| Material | Thickness | Pierce Time | Pierce Strategy |
|----------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Mild Steel** | 0.060" | 0.3 sec | Direct pierce, full power |
| **Mild Steel** | 0.250" | 0.8 sec | Ramp pierce, reduced power start |
| **Mild Steel** | 0.500" | 1.5 sec | Multi-step pierce with power ramp |
| **Stainless** | 0.105" | 0.5 sec | Reduced power pierce (prevent blowback) |
| **Aluminum** | 0.125" | 0.6 sec | Higher gas pressure pierce |

**Pierce Optimization:**
- **Pre-drilled holes:** Eliminate pierce time by pre-drilling start holes
- **Common pierce points:** Start multiple features from single pierce
- **Edge start:** Begin cutting from sheet edge when possible (zero pierce time)
