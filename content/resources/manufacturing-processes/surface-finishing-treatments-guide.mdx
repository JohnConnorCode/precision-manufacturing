- **Wear Resistance:** 200-400% improvement in surface hardness through hard anodizing or coating
- **Fatigue Life Enhancement:** 50-150% improvement through processes like shot peening (reduced stress concentrations)
- **Reduced Friction:** 40-70% reduction in coefficient of friction with dry film lubricants
- **Enhanced Appearance:** Professional finish with color coding capabilities for identification

## Understanding Surface Finishing Fundamentals

- Alternative: Mask critical features (bores, threads) to prevent coating buildup

**Cost Considerations:**
- Processing: $2.00-5.00 per square foot (higher than Type II due to longer time, refrigeration)
- Masking: $75-200 per lot (critical features must be masked)
- Lead time: 7-14 business days typical

## Passivation of Stainless Steel

## Conclusion

Surface finishing and treatment processes are critical elements of aerospace component manufacturing, providing essential corrosion protection, wear resistance, fatigue life enhancement, and dimensional control. The right surface treatment, properly applied and verified, can extend component life by 300-500% and prevent costly failures.

**Key Takeaways:**

- Anodizing provides excellent corrosion protection for aluminum (500-1000+ hours salt spray)
- Type III hard anodizing delivers wear resistance approaching hardened steel (400-700 HV)
- Passivation is mandatory for stainless steel corrosion protection (removes free iron)
- Electropolishing provides superior surface for medical and high-purity applications
- Shot peening improves fatigue life by 100-300% through compressive residual stresses
- Process sequence matters: machine → heat treat → finish machine → surface treat
- Specifications are non-negotiable for aerospace: MIL-A-8625, AMS 2700, etc.
- Testing and documentation are essential: coating thickness, salt spray, adhesion

Success with surface finishing requires understanding process capabilities, proper specification selection, quality process control, and comprehensive testing and documentation. Integration with precision machining and heat treatment ensures optimal results and full compliance with aerospace quality requirements.
