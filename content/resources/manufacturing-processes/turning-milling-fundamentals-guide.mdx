## CNC Milling Fundamentals

### What is CNC Milling?

CNC milling is a machining process that uses computer-controlled rotary cutters to remove material from a workpiece. The cutting tool rotates at high speed while the workpiece moves along multiple axes (typically X, Y, and Z) to create the desired geometry.

**3-Axis Milling Capabilities:**

| Parameter | Standard Range | High-Performance Range | Typical Applications |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Work Envelope** | 20" × 16" × 16" | 40" × 30" × 24" | General parts to large structural components |
| **Spindle Speed** | 3,000-8,000 RPM | 10,000-15,000 RPM | Standard machining to high-speed aluminum |

### Speeds and Feeds for Milling

**Fundamental Formulas:**

**Surface Speed (SFM - Surface Feet per Minute):**
```
SFM = (π × Diameter in inches × RPM) / 12
RPM = (SFM × 12) / (π × Diameter in inches)
RPM = (SFM × 3.82) / Diameter in inches
```

**Feed Rate (IPM - Inches per Minute):**
```
IPM = RPM × Number of Teeth × Chip Load
Chip Load = IPM / (RPM × Number of Teeth)
```

**Material Removal Rate (MRR):**
```
MRR (cubic inches/min) = Width of Cut × Depth of Cut × Feed Rate
```

**Recommended Cutting Speeds for Common Materials:**

| Material | HSS (SFM) | Carbide (SFM) | Chip Load per Tooth (0.500" dia) | Notes |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| **Aluminum 6061-T6** | 300-500 | 800-2000 | 0.005-0.012" | Use high speeds, flood coolant |
| **Aluminum 7075-T6** | 250-400 | 700-1500 | 0.004-0.010" | More abrasive than 6061 |
| **Mild Steel (1018)** | 80-120 | 400-600 | 0.003-0.008" | Coolant required |
| **Stainless 304/316** | 50-80 | 250-400 | 0.002-0.006" | Work hardens, keep tool sharp |
| **Titanium Ti-6Al-4V** | 30-50 | 150-300 | 0.002-0.005" | Low speed, high feed, flood coolant |
| **Tool Steel (P20)** | 50-70 | 200-350 | 0.002-0.005" | Hardness dependent |
| **Plastics (Delrin)** | 300-600 | 600-1200 | 0.004-0.010" | Sharp tools, air blast only |
| **Brass/Bronze** | 200-300 | 500-800 | 0.004-0.008" | Free-machining, minimal coolant |

**Example Calculation - 0.500" Diameter 4-Flute Carbide End Mill in Aluminum 6061:**

```
Target SFM: 1200 (carbide in aluminum)
RPM = (1200 × 3.82) / 0.500 = 9,168 RPM

Chip Load: 0.008" per tooth (from table)
Feed Rate = 9,168 × 4 flutes × 0.008" = 293 IPM

Width of Cut: 0.250" (50% stepover)
Depth of Cut: 0.150" (30% of diameter)
MRR = 0.250 × 0.150 × 293 = 11.0 cubic inches per minute
```

## CNC Lathe Turning Fundamentals

### What is CNC Turning?

CNC turning is a machining process where the workpiece rotates while a stationary cutting tool removes material. The tool moves along two primary axes (X for diameter, Z for length) to create cylindrical, conical, and complex rotational geometries.

**CNC Lathe Capabilities:**

| **Bar Capacity** | 3-6" diameter | 0.062-2.00" diameter | Standard stock vs. small diameter work |
| **Maximum Length** | 20-40" | 12-20" | Shaft work vs. precision components |
| **Spindle Speed** | 3,000-5,000 RPM | 6,000-12,000 RPM | Standard turning vs. high-speed small parts |
| **Positioning Accuracy** | ±0.0005" (±0.013mm) | ±0.0001" (±0.0025mm) | General precision to ultra-precision |
| **Surface Finish** | Ra 32-63 μin (0.8-1.6 μm) | Ra 8-16 μin (0.2-0.4 μm) | Standard to mirror finish |

```
SFM = (π × Diameter in inches × RPM) / 12
RPM = (SFM × 3.82) / Diameter in inches
```

**Feed Rate (IPM):**
```
IPM = RPM × Feed per Revolution (IPR)
```

**Metal Removal Rate:**
```
MRR (cubic inches/min) = 12 × SFM × Depth of Cut × Feed per Revolution
```

**Recommended Turning Parameters:**

| Material | SFM (Carbide) | Feed - Roughing (IPR) | Feed - Finishing (IPR) | Depth - Roughing | Depth - Finishing |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------|-------------------|

| **Tool Steel (annealed)** | 200-350 | 0.010-0.018 | 0.004-0.008 | 0.080-0.150" | 0.008-0.015" |

**Example Calculation - Turning 2.000" Diameter 304 Stainless Steel:**

```
Target SFM: 350 (carbide in stainless)
RPM = (350 × 3.82) / 2.000 = 669 RPM (use 650 RPM)

Roughing Pass:
Feed per Revolution: 0.015 IPR
Depth of Cut: 0.100" (reduces diameter by 0.200")
Feed Rate = 650 × 0.015 = 9.75 IPM

Finishing Pass:
Feed per Revolution: 0.006 IPR
Depth of Cut: 0.010" (reduces diameter by 0.020")
Feed Rate = 650 × 0.006 = 3.9 IPM

### Tolerance Design Recommendations

**Design for Manufacturability (DFM) Guidelines:**

1. **Specify tolerances only where functionally required** - Every tighter tolerance increases cost 15-50%
2. **Use standard tolerances** - ±0.005" for milling, ±0.003" for turning reduces cost and lead time
3. **Consider material and process capabilities** - Softer materials achieve tighter tolerances more easily
4. **Avoid tolerance stack-ups** - Dimension from functional datums, not chain dimensioning
5. **Communicate critical features** - Call out which dimensions/surfaces are most important

For detailed design optimization, see our [Design for Manufacturability Guide](/resources/design-for-manufacturability-guide) and [GD&T Geometric Tolerancing Guide](/resources/gdt-geometric-tolerancing-guide).

## Process Selection: Turning vs. Milling

### When to Use Turning

**Ideal Applications:**
- Cylindrical parts (shafts, bushings, sleeves)
- Rotational symmetry dominates the geometry
- High length-to-diameter ratio parts
- High-volume production of similar parts
- Surface finish critical on round surfaces

**Advantages:**
- **Faster for Cylindrical Work:** 2-5× faster than milling for round parts
- **Superior Surface Finish:** Ra 8-16 μin easily achievable on turned surfaces
- **Better Concentricity:** Inherent process advantage for coaxial features
- **Lower Cost for Round Parts:** Simpler setup, faster cycle times
- **Material Efficiency:** Minimal waste compared to milling from solid

**Example:** A 2.000" diameter × 6.000" long shaft with multiple diameters:
- Turning: 15-25 minutes cycle time, Ra 16 μin finish, ±0.0005" diameter tolerance
- Milling: 45-90 minutes cycle time, Ra 32-63 μin finish, ±0.001" typical

### When to Use Milling

**Ideal Applications:**
- Prismatic parts (blocks, plates, housings)
- Complex 3D geometries
- Multiple non-parallel features
- Pocketing and cavity work
- Parts requiring multiple-axis access

**Advantages:**
- **Geometric Flexibility:** Can machine any 3D shape
- **Feature Variety:** Drill, tap, slot, pocket in single setup
- **Large Flat Surfaces:** Superior for deck surfaces and mounting faces
- **Complex Contours:** 3D profiling and surfacing capabilities
- **Multi-Part Fixturing:** Machine multiple parts per cycle

**Example:** A 4" × 6" × 2" aluminum housing with pockets and holes:
- Milling: Ideal process, 45-90 minutes depending on complexity
- Turning: Not practical for prismatic geometry

### Combined Operations

Modern manufacturing often uses both processes:

**Mill-Turn Centers:**
- Combined capabilities in single machine
- Reduces setups and part handling
- Improves accuracy through single-setup machining
- Higher capital cost but lower per-part cost for complex geometries
- Typical investment: $300K-800K vs. $80K-150K for dedicated machines

**Sequential Operations:**
- Turn basic geometry, then mill features
- Example: Turn a cylinder, then mill flats and cross-holes
- Requires careful fixturing for second operation
- Maintain datum references between operations

- See our [Design for Manufacturability Guide](/resources/design-for-manufacturability-guide)

**3. Batch Size Optimization:**

| Quantity | Setup Impact | Unit Cost Strategy |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **1-5 pieces** | Setup = 50-80% of cost | Minimize setup complexity, use standard tooling |
| **10-50 pieces** | Setup = 20-40% of cost | Optimize program, consider basic fixturing |
| **100-500 pieces** | Setup = 5-15% of cost | Custom fixtures, optimized tooling justified |
| **1000+ pieces** | Setup = <5% of cost | Dedicated tooling, automation, lights-out machining |

**4. Tool Life Management:**
- Optimize speeds/feeds for tool life vs. cycle time balance
- A 20% speed reduction can double tool life, saving money despite longer cycle
- Tool cost typically 3-8% of machining cost; balance carefully

**5. Tolerance Specification:**
- Specify only necessary tolerances
- Cost increase by tolerance level:
  - ±0.005" = Baseline cost
  - ±0.001" = +20-30% cost
  - ±0.0005" = +40-60% cost
  - ±0.0002" = +80-120% cost
