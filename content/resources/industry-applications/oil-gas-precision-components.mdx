### Corrosion Mechanisms and Material Selection

**Primary Corrosion Mechanisms in Oil & Gas:**

| Mechanism | Cause | Susceptible Materials | Mitigation Strategies |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Sulfide Stress Cracking (SSC)** | H2S + tensile stress | Carbon/low-alloy steels >HRC 22 | NACE-compliant materials, hardness control |
| **Hydrogen Embrittlement** | Atomic hydrogen diffusion | High-strength steels, hardened alloys | Limit hardness, use resistant alloys, coatings |
| **Sweet Corrosion (CO2)** | Carbonic acid formation | Carbon steel, low-alloy steel | CRAs, inhibitors, coatings |
| **Pitting/Crevice Corrosion** | Chlorides + oxygen | Stainless steels (especially 304/316) | Higher-grade CRAs (duplex, 6Mo, nickel alloys) |
| **Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC)** | Chlorides + tensile stress | Austenitic stainless under stress | Duplex stainless, stress relief, cathodic protection |
| **Erosion-Corrosion** | High velocity + solids + corrosive fluid | All materials, especially soft alloys | Hard facings, wear-resistant alloys, design modifications |
| **Galvanic Corrosion** | Dissimilar metals in electrolyte | More anodic metal in couple | Isolate materials, use similar alloys, coatings |

**Material Selection Decision Tree:**

1. **Determine H2S Content:**
   - No H2S: Sweet service, carbon steel acceptable with CO2 corrosion management
   - <100 ppm H2S: Mild sour, carbon steel with NACE compliance (HRC <22)
   - >100 ppm H2S: Moderate to severe sour, evaluate CRAs

2. **Evaluate Pressure and Temperature:**
   - <5,000 PSI, <200°F: Carbon steel or 13Cr stainless may suffice
   - 5,000-10,000 PSI, 200-300°F: Duplex stainless or super 13Cr
   - >10,000 PSI, >300°F: Nickel alloys or advanced CRAs

3. **Consider Chloride Content:**
   - <20,000 ppm: 316 stainless acceptable in absence of H2S/stress
   - 20,000-100,000 ppm: Duplex stainless recommended
   - >100,000 ppm: Super duplex or nickel alloys

4. **Assess Mechanical Stress:**
   - Low stress, static: Material selection based on corrosion only
   - High stress, cyclic: Fatigue-resistant alloys, consider SSC/SCC
   - Impact loading: Toughness required, avoid brittle materials

|------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **High-Pressure Water (No H2S)** | Electroless nickel or hard chrome | Corrosion protection, smooth surface |
| **Erosive Slurries** | Tungsten carbide HVOF or ceramic | Maximum wear resistance |
| **Sour Service (H2S Present)** | Carefully selected (some coatings trap hydrogen) | Ensure NACE compliance, test for embrittlement |
| **Reciprocating Wear** | Hard chrome, nitriding, or PVD | Low friction, wear resistance |
| **High Temperature (>400°F)** | Ceramic coatings or diffusion treatments (nitriding) | Thermal stability required |

**Coating Compatibility Warning:**
- Some coatings can increase hydrogen embrittlement risk in sour service
- Verify coating compatibility with NACE MR0175 requirements
- Pre-plating stress relief and post-plating baking may be required
- Consult coating supplier and end-user specifications

**NACE-Compliant Heat Treatment for Carbon/Low-Alloy Steels:**

**Objective:** Achieve HRC 22 maximum hardness throughout component.

**Process:**
1. **Quench:** Heat to austenitizing temperature (1500-1650°F depending on alloy), hold for 1 hr per inch thickness minimum
2. **Cool:** Water or oil quench (depends on section size and alloy)
3. **Temper:** Reheat to 1050-1200°F (determines final hardness), hold 2 hours minimum per inch thickness
4. **Cool:** Air cool to ambient
5. **Stress Relief (if required):** 1000-1100°F, hold 1 hr per inch, slow cool

**Hardness Testing:**
- Test after heat treatment before machining (verify process)
- Test after final machining (verify final component)
- Minimum 3 readings per area, report average and maximum
- If any reading exceeds HRC 22, re-temper to reduce hardness

## Pressure Testing and Quality Verification

### Hydrostatic Pressure Testing

Pressure testing verifies the integrity of pressure-containing components before service.

**Hydrostatic Test Requirements:**

| Component Type | Test Pressure | Hold Time | Acceptance Criteria | Test Fluid |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| **Valves (API 6A)** | 1.5× rated working pressure | 3-15 minutes depending on size | No visible leakage, no structural damage | Water with corrosion inhibitor |
| **Wellhead Equipment** | 1.5× rated working pressure | Per API 6A (3-10 min typical) | Zero leakage through body or seals | Water or oil-based fluid |
| **Piping/Tubing** | 1.5× design pressure | 10-30 minutes | No leakage, no permanent deformation | Water (preferred) or compressed air (with precautions) |
| **Pressure Vessels** | 1.3-1.5× MAWP (maximum allowable working pressure) | Per ASME VIII, typically 10-30 minutes | No leakage, no permanent deformation | Water with corrosion inhibitor |
| **Fittings** | 1.5-2.0× working pressure | 5-15 minutes | No leakage through body or threads | Water |

**Hydrostatic Test Procedure:**

1. **Preparation:**
   - Clean component (remove dirt, debris, oil)
   - Install test plugs, blanks, or closures
   - Connect to pressure source and calibrated pressure gage (±1% accuracy)
   - Vent all air pockets (air compresses, water does not)

2. **Pressurization:**
   - Increase pressure gradually (50-100 PSI/minute typical)
   - Stop at 50% of test pressure, inspect for leaks
   - Continue to full test pressure
   - Isolate pressure source (close valve)

3. **Hold Period:**
   - Monitor pressure (should remain stable; small drop acceptable due to temperature equilibration)
   - Visually inspect all surfaces for leakage (weepage, drips)
   - Check for permanent deformation (bulging, distortion)

4. **Depressurization:**
   - Release pressure slowly (100-200 PSI/minute)
   - Open vent to drain test fluid
   - Remove test plugs/closures

5. **Documentation:**
   - Record: part number, serial number, test pressure, hold time, temperature, gage ID, operator, date
   - Pass/Fail determination
   - Stamp or tag component with test date and pressure

**Safety Considerations:**

- **Never use compressed air or gas for testing** unless absolutely necessary (explosion hazard if component fails)
- If pneumatic testing required: use minimum pressure, physical barriers, remote monitoring
- Always wear safety glasses and maintain safe distance during pressurization
- Use pressure relief valve set at 110% of test pressure to prevent over-pressure

### Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)

NDT methods verify component integrity without causing damage.

**NDT Methods for Oil & Gas Components:**

| Method | Detects | Advantages | Limitations | Typical Cost |

## Design Considerations for Oil & Gas Components

### Design for Extreme Service Conditions

**Pressure Design:**

- **Design Factor:** 2.0-4.0 on ultimate strength (higher for critical safety components)
- **Stress Analysis:** FEA (Finite Element Analysis) for complex geometries
- **Pressure Containment:** Hoop stress, longitudinal stress, von Mises stress evaluation
- **Burst Pressure:** Minimum 4× working pressure for critical components

**Temperature Considerations:**

- **Thermal Expansion:** Account for differential expansion between materials
- **Clearances:** Design clearances to accommodate thermal growth
- **Material Properties:** Verify strength/ductility at operating temperature
- **Thermal Cycling:** Consider fatigue from temperature fluctuations

**Corrosion Allowance:**

- Add material thickness for expected corrosion (0.062-0.125" typical)
- Base on corrosion rate (mils per year) × expected service life
- Example: 5 mpy (mils per year) × 20 years = 100 mils = 0.100" corrosion allowance

**Fatigue and Cyclic Loading:**

- **Stress Concentration:** Minimize with generous radii (R = 0.25-0.50× wall thickness minimum)
- **Fatigue Analysis:** S-N curves for material at operating environment
- **Cycles to Failure:** Design for 10× expected cycles minimum
- **Inspection Intervals:** Define based on crack growth analysis

### Design for Manufacturability

**Machining Considerations:**

| Design Feature | Poor Practice | Best Practice | Reason |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| **Inside Corners** | Sharp 90° corners | Radius = 0.030-0.125" minimum | Tool access, stress concentration reduction |
| **Deep Holes** | L/D ratio >10:1 | Keep L/D <8:1, or use gun drilling | Drill deflection, straightness challenges |
| **Thread Relief** | No relief groove | Relief groove = 1.5× thread pitch width | Thread tool runout, full thread depth to shoulder |
| **Wall Thickness** | Abrupt changes | Gradual transitions, blended radii | Stress distribution, machining stability |
| **Tolerances** | Tight tolerances globally | Tolerances only where required | Cost reduction, machinability |

**Welding Considerations:**

- **Joint Design:** Full penetration groove welds for pressure vessels
- **Weld Access:** Minimum 1" clearance for torch access
- **Backing:** Design for backing bars or consumable inserts where needed
- **Inspection Access:** Plan for RT or UT probe access to weld areas

**Assembly Considerations:**

- **Fastener Access:** Clearance for wrench/socket (1.5× fastener diameter minimum)
- **Alignment:** Dowel pins, pilot diameters for accurate component alignment
- **Disassembly:** Design for field maintenance and repair
- **Sealing:** Specify O-ring grooves per AS568 or ISO 3601 standards

For comprehensive design optimization, see our [Design for Manufacturability Guide](/resources/design-for-manufacturability-guide).
