# ITAR Compliance Guide for Defense Manufacturing

## Introduction

The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) governs the manufacture, sale, and distribution of defense articles and services. For manufacturers serving the defense industry, ITAR compliance isn't optional‚Äîit's essential for legal operation and maintaining contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and defense contractors.

At IIS, we've maintained ITAR registration and compliance for over 15 years, enabling us to serve defense contractors with the highest levels of security and regulatory adherence.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Notice:**
This guide provides general information about ITAR compliance. Always consult with qualified export control attorneys and the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) for specific compliance requirements. ITAR violations can result in severe civil and criminal penalties, including fines up to $1M per violation and 20 years imprisonment.

## What is ITAR?

### Definition and Scope

ITAR is a set of U.S. government regulations that control the export and import of defense-related articles, services, and technical data. Administered by the U.S. Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), ITAR covers items on the United States Munitions List (USML).

### Key Components of ITAR

| Component | Details | Impact |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Governing Body** | DDTC (Directorate of Defense Trade Controls), U.S. State Department | Final authority on export licensing and compliance |
| **Primary List** | USML (United States Munitions List) - 21 categories | Defines controlled defense articles, services, and technical data |
| **Civil Violations** | Up to $1,094,010 per violation (as of 2024) | Per-violation penalties can exceed $10M for multiple infractions |
| **Criminal Penalties** | Up to $1M fine + 20 years imprisonment per violation | Individual officers and employees can be personally liable |
| **Debarment** | Loss of export privileges | Company effectively barred from defense work |

### Who Must Comply?

**Required for:**
- Manufacturers of defense articles
- Exporters of defense articles
- Brokers of defense articles
- Providers of defense services
- Anyone handling ITAR-controlled technical data

## Registration Requirements

### Who Must Register?

Any person or entity in the United States who engages in:
- Manufacturing defense articles
- Exporting defense articles
- Providing defense services
- Brokering activities

### Registration Process

1. **Determine Requirement**
   - Review USML categories
   - Assess business activities
   - Consult legal counsel

2. **Prepare Documentation**
   - DS-2032 Statement of Registration
   - Corporate structure documentation
   - Key management identification
   - Product/service descriptions

3. **Submit Application**
   - Online via DECCS system
   - Registration fee payment
   - Supporting documentation

4. **Maintain Registration**
   - Annual renewal required
   - Update material changes
   - Maintain compliance records

**ITAR Registration Key Facts:**

| Item | Requirement | Details |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Registration Fee** | $2,250 annually | Non-refundable; due at initial registration and renewal |
| **Processing Time** | 4-8 weeks typical | Can extend to 12+ weeks with incomplete applications |
| **Renewal Period** | 12 months from issuance | Must renew before expiration; operating without valid registration is a violation |
| **Record Retention** | 5 years minimum | All registration records, correspondence, and related documents |
| **Reporting Changes** | Within 60 days | Material changes to business, ownership, facilities must be reported |

## Technical Data Control

### Definition of Technical Data

Under ITAR, technical data includes:
- Blueprints and drawings
- Specifications
- Software and source code
- Manuals and instructions
- Manufacturing processes
- Test data and results

### Control Measures

**Physical Security:**
- Locked storage areas
- Access control systems
- Visitor restrictions
- Clean desk policies

**Digital Security:**
- Encrypted storage
- Access controls
- Audit logging
- Secure communications

**Personnel Security:**
- Background checks
- U.S. person verification
- Training requirements
- Non-disclosure agreements

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical "U.S. Person" Requirement:**

Only U.S. persons may access ITAR-controlled technical data without export authorization. This includes:
- **U.S. Citizens:** Native-born or naturalized citizens
- **Lawful Permanent Residents:** Green card holders ONLY (not visa holders)
- **Protected Persons:** Asylees and refugees with specific status

**NOT U.S. Persons (Require Export License):**
- H-1B, L-1, F-1, J-1 visa holders (even with EAD)
- Dual nationals from non-exempt countries
- Canadian citizens (limited exemptions exist)

**Practical Impact:** Showing a drawing to an H-1B engineer = export to their home country = requires DDTC license

## Manufacturing Compliance

### Facility Requirements

**Physical Security:**
- Perimeter security
- Controlled access areas
- Surveillance systems
- Intrusion detection

**Information Security:**
- IT infrastructure controls
- Network segmentation
- Data encryption
- Removable media controls

**Personnel Controls:**
- Employee screening
- Training programs
- Access authorization
- Visitor management

### Production Controls

**Material Control:**
- Source verification
- Chain of custody
- Inventory management
- Disposal procedures

**Process Control:**
- Work instructions
- Quality procedures
- Change management
- Non-conformance handling

**Documentation:**
- Manufacturing records
- Inspection reports
- Shipping documentation
- Compliance records

## Export Controls

### License Requirements

**When Required:**
- Physical export of defense articles
- Transfer of technical data
- Defense services provision
- Temporary import/export

**License Types:**
- DSP-5: Permanent export
- DSP-73: Temporary export
- DSP-61: Temporary import
- TAA: Technical Assistance Agreement
- MLA: Manufacturing License Agreement

### Exemptions

**Common Exemptions:**
- Canadian exemption (limited)
- U.S. Government contracts
- Certain NATO operations
- Previously authorized exports

**üí° Export License Best Practice:**

**Golden Rule:** When in doubt, apply for a license. The risk-reward calculation is clear:
- **Risk of unlicensed export:** $1M+ fines, 20 years imprisonment, company debarment
- **Cost of unnecessary license:** $0 application fee + 30-60 day wait
- **DDTC guidance:** "It is better to seek authorization when not required than to fail to seek authorization when required"

**Common Mistake:** Assuming Canadian exemption applies broadly. It's narrowly limited and frequently misapplied.

## Recordkeeping Requirements

**Registration Records:**
- Registration certificates
- Correspondence with DDTC
- Corporate documentation
- Key personnel records

**Transaction Records:**
- Purchase orders
- Shipping documents
- Export licenses

- Corrective actions

### Retention Periods

**ITAR Record Retention Requirements:**

| Record Type | Retention Period | Storage Requirements | Audit Notes |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Export Records** | 5 years from export date | Secure, retrievable within 48 hours | Most commonly requested during audits |
| **Registration Records** | 5 years from expiration | Include all amendments and correspondence | Must show continuous registration |
| **License Records** | 5 years from expiration/termination | Complete file with all amendments | Include usage reports and compliance docs |
| **Violation/Disclosure Records** | Permanent retention | Separate secure file | Shows remediation and prevents repeat violations |
| **Training Records** | Duration of employment + 5 years | Individual and group training docs | DDTC verifies training during inspections |

## Common Violations and Penalties

### Typical Violations

1. **Unauthorized Exports**
   - Shipping without license
   - Exceeding license scope
   - Expired license use
