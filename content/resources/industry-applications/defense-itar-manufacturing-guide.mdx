# ITAR Compliance Guide for Defense Manufacturing

## Introduction

The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) governs the manufacture, sale, and distribution of defense articles and services. For manufacturers serving the defense industry, ITAR compliance isn't optionalâ€”it's essential for legal operation and maintaining contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and defense contractors.

At IIS, we've maintained ITAR registration and compliance for over 15 years, enabling us to serve defense contractors with the highest levels of security and regulatory adherence.

<CalloutBox type="warning" title="Legal Notice">
This guide provides general information about ITAR compliance. Always consult with legal counsel and the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) for specific compliance requirements.
