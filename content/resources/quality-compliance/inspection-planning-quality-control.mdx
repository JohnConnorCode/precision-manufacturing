# Inspection Planning and Quality Control Strategy Guide

## Introduction

Inspection planning and quality control form the foundation of precision manufacturing, ensuring parts meet specifications, processes remain in control, and customers receive zero-defect products. From first article inspection validating new processes to statistical process control monitoring production, comprehensive inspection strategies prevent defects, reduce scrap, and provide objective evidence of quality.

**Why Inspection Planning is Critical:**

- **Defect Prevention:** Catch issues early (in-process inspection) before hundreds of defective parts produced
- **Process Control:** Statistical process control (SPC) detects process shifts before parts go out of tolerance
- **Cost Reduction:** Early detection saves 10-100× cost vs. final inspection rejection or field failure
- **Customer Confidence:** Documented inspection results (first article, PPAP, certificates of conformance) prove quality
- **Regulatory Compliance:** AS9100D, ISO 9001, IATF 16949, FDA QSR require documented inspection and control
- **Continuous Improvement:** Inspection data drives root cause analysis, corrective action, process optimization
- **Liability Protection:** Inspection records demonstrate due diligence (critical for safety-critical components)

**Inspection Hierarchy (Cost vs. Effectiveness):**

| Inspection Timing | Cost to Detect Defect | Cost to Correct | Effectiveness | Example |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| **Design Review (Prevention)** | $10 | $100 | 95-99% defects prevented | DFMEA, DFM review catch potential issues |
| **First Article (Validation)** | $100 | $500 | 80-95% process issues caught | Prove process capable before production |
| **In-Process (Detection)** | $50 | $200 | 70-90% defects caught early | SPC, patrol inspection during machining |
| **Final Inspection** | $100 | $1,000 | 50-80% defects caught late | CMM, functional test, visual inspection |
| **Customer Inspection** | $500 | $10,000 | Defect escaped factory | Return, investigation, corrective action |
| **Field Failure** | $5,000 | $100,000+ | Product failed in service | Warranty, recall, liability, reputation damage |

**Key Principle:** Shift inspection upstream (earlier in process) to reduce total cost of quality.

At IIS, we implement comprehensive inspection planning including first article inspection per AS9102, statistical process control for production, and measurement systems analysis (MSA) to ensure our inspection systems are capable. This guide provides the knowledge to develop effective inspection strategies for aerospace, medical, defense, and industrial manufacturing.

## Control Plan Development

### Control Plan Purpose and Types

**Control Plan:** Living document describing the controls (inspections, process parameters, reaction plans) for each process step to ensure quality output.

**Control Plan Types:**

| Type | When Used | Detail Level | Inspection Frequency | Typical Duration |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Prototype** | Pre-production samples, development | Basic process, key characteristics | 100% critical features | Until design frozen |
| **Pre-Launch** | Pilot run, PPAP production | Extensive controls, tight monitoring | 100% critical, high-frequency others | 30-90 days before launch |
| **Production** | Ongoing production | Optimized controls, sampling | Sample-based, SPC for critical | Life of production |

### Control Plan Structure

**Control Plan Columns (Per AIAG):**

| Column | Information | Example | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **1. Part Number/Name** | Unique identifier | P/N 12345-001, Crankshaft Main Journal | Identify part |
| **2. Part/Process Change Level** | Revision, ECO number | Rev C, ECO-2024-045 | Track version |
| **3. Process Step Number** | Sequential operation | Op 30: Grind Main Journals | Order of operations |
| **4. Process Name/Description** | What happens at this step | Centerless Grind - Journal Diameter | Clear description |
| **5. Machine/Device/Jig** | Equipment used | Cincinnati Centerless Grinder #5 | Equipment traceability |
| **6. Characteristics** | Feature being controlled | Main Journal Diameter, Surface Finish | What is measured |
| **7. Product Specification/Tolerance** | Drawing requirement | Ø 2.2440-2.2445", 16 Ra max | Acceptance criteria |
| **8. Evaluation/Measurement Technique** | How to measure | Air gage (Marposs E9C), profilometer | Measurement method |
| **9. Sample Size** | How many parts | 5 parts per subgroup | Statistical validity |
| **10. Sample Frequency** | How often to measure | Every hour | Detection timing |
| **11. Control Method** | Control type (SPC, 100%, functional) | X-bar & R Chart, Cpk monitoring | Statistical or attribute |
| **12. Reaction Plan** | What if out of spec | Stop production, 100% sort, adjust grind wheel dress | Corrective action |

### Characteristic Classification

**Special Characteristics (Critical Features):**

Different industries use different symbols to denote special characteristics requiring enhanced controls:

| Industry | Symbol | Classification | Meaning | Control Requirement |
|----------|--------|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Automotive** | ◆ (Diamond) | Critical | Safety-critical, government regulation | Cpk >1.67, SPC, 100% inspection or mistake-proofing |
|  | ▲ (Triangle) | Key | Major impact on fit/function | Cpk >1.33, SPC or frequent inspection |
|  | ● (Circle) | Significant | Moderate impact on quality | Cpk >1.33, periodic inspection |
| **Aerospace** | SC (Special Char) | Special Characteristic | Safety, performance, or regulatory | First article, ongoing inspection per plan |
|  | CC (Critical Char) | Critical Characteristic | Safety of flight | 100% inspection, Cpk >1.67, full traceability |
| **Medical** | ☆ (Star) | Critical to Quality (CTQ) | Patient safety, efficacy | Design control, validation, 100% or sample per risk |

**Identifying Special Characteristics:**

```
Decision Process:

Safety Impact?
├─ YES → Critical Characteristic (◆ automotive, CC aerospace)
│         Require: Cpk >1.67-2.0, 100% inspection or mistake-proofing, SPC
└─ NO → Continue

Function Impact?
├─ High (part won't assemble, won't function) → Key Characteristic (▲)
│         Require: Cpk >1.33, SPC or high-frequency inspection
├─ Moderate (degraded performance, cosmetic) → Significant (●)
│         Require: Cpk >1.33, periodic inspection
└─ Low (no significant impact) → Standard Characteristic
          Require: Cpk >1.0, sample inspection
```

### Example Control Plan (Excerpt)

**Part: Aerospace Actuator Shaft P/N AS-1234**

| Step | Process | Machine | Characteristic | Spec/Tol | Measurement | Sample Size/Freq | Control Method | Reaction Plan |
|------|---------|---------|---------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **10** | CNC Turn OD | Mazak QT-250 | OD Diameter ◆ (Critical) | Ø 1.0000-1.0005" | Air gage (Marposs) | n=5, every 2 hours | X-bar & R, Cpk >1.67 | Stop line, 100% inspect since last good, adjust offset, verify Cpk |
| **10** | CNC Turn OD | Mazak QT-250 | Surface Finish ▲ (Key) | 32 Ra max | Profilometer | n=1, every 8 hours | Trending, limit 32 Ra | Alert if >28 Ra (approaching limit), replace tool, verify |

| **40** | Final Inspect | Bench | Visual ● (Significant) | No scratches, dents, burrs | 10× magnification, light | 100% | Visual inspection | Rework (deburr, polish) or scrap if damage deep |

## Inspection Frequency and Sampling Strategies

### Sampling Plans (AQL - Acceptable Quality Level)

**ANSI/ASQ Z1.4 (MIL-STD-105E) Sampling Tables:**

**Concept:** Sample a subset of lot, accept or reject entire lot based on sample defects.

**AQL (Acceptable Quality Level):** Maximum percent defective considered acceptable (e.g., AQL 1.0 = 1% defective acceptable).

**Sampling Plan Example:**

```
Lot Size: 500 parts
Inspection Level: II (normal)
AQL: 1.0 (1% defective acceptable)

From Z1.4 Table:
- Sample Size Code Letter: H
- Sample Size: 50 parts
- Acceptance Number (Ac): 2 (accept lot if ≤2 defects in sample)
- Rejection Number (Re): 3 (reject lot if ≥3 defects in sample)

Inspection Result:
- Sample 50 parts from lot of 500
- Find 1 defect → ACCEPT lot (1 ≤ 2)
- Find 3 defects → REJECT lot (3 ≥ 3), 100% inspect and sort

Actual lot quality if accepting: 1 defect in 50 sample suggests ~10 defects in 500-part lot (2% defect rate), but still acceptable per AQL 1.0 plan.
```

**When to Use AQL Sampling:**

- **High-volume production:** 100% inspection impractical (>1,000 parts/lot)
- **Non-critical features:** Defects cause inconvenience, not safety issues
- **Established process:** Cpk >1.33, stable history, few defects expected

**When NOT to Use AQL (100% Inspection Required):**

- **Safety-critical features:** Aerospace safety of flight, medical patient safety, automotive safety
- **Low-volume, high-value:** Cost of 100% inspection low vs. part value
- **New process:** Cpk unknown or <1.33, high defect risk

### Statistical Sampling for Continuous Production

**Variables Data (Dimensions):**

**Subgroup Sampling (X-bar & R Chart):**

| Production Volume | Subgroup Size (n) | Frequency | Rational Subgroup | Purpose |
|------------------|------------------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| **<100 parts/day** | n=3-5 | Every 10-25 parts | Consecutive parts from single setup | Detect setup errors, tool wear |
| **100-1,000 parts/day** | n=3-5 | Every 1-2 hours | Random sample from period | Detect process shifts over time |
| **>1,000 parts/day** | n=5-10 | Every 30-60 minutes | Systematic sample (e.g., every 100th part) | Continuous process monitoring |

**Attributes Data (Pass/Fail):**

**p-Chart or np-Chart:**

| Lot Size | Sample Size | Frequency | Acceptance Criteria | Action if Failed |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| **100-500** | 50-100 parts | Per lot or per shift | p ≤ 0.02 (2% defective) | 100% inspect lot, corrective action |
| **500-1,000** | 100-200 parts | Every 2-4 hours | p ≤ 0.01 (1% defective) | Investigate, increase frequency if trending up |
| **>1,000** | 200-300 parts | Every 1-2 hours | p ≤ 0.005 (0.5% defective) | SPC monitoring, react to out-of-control signals |

### Patrol Inspection vs. Final Inspection

**Patrol Inspection (In-Process):**

**Purpose:** Detect process issues during production before many defective parts are made.

**Typical Frequency:**
- Machining operations: Every 1-4 hours (or every 10-50 parts for low volume)
- Assembly operations: Every 30 minutes to 2 hours
- High-speed processes (stamping, molding): Every 15-60 minutes

**What to Inspect:**
- Critical dimensions (特 characteristics)
- Process parameters (temperatures, pressures, speeds)
- Surface condition (burrs, scratches, cosmetic)
- Fixture condition (wear, looseness)

**Example: CNC Machining Patrol Inspection**

```
Part: Hydraulic Manifold
Critical Feature: Port thread depth 0.650-0.680"

Patrol Frequency: Every 2 hours (approximately 25 parts)

Inspection Process:
1. Operator selects 3 consecutive parts from current production
2. Measure thread depth with depth micrometer (±0.001" accuracy)
3. Record on X-bar & R chart
4. Check against control limits:
   - If within limits: Continue production
   - If outside limits or trending: Stop, investigate, adjust, verify, resume
5. Sign and timestamp inspection record

Time per Inspection: 5 minutes (minimal production interruption)

Benefit: Catch tool wear, offset drift before 100+ parts affected
```

**Final Inspection:**

**Purpose:** Verify finished part meets all specifications before shipment.

**Frequency:**
- Sample-based (per AQL or customer requirement): 10-100% depending on volume, criticality
- 100% for safety-critical or low-volume (<100 parts)

**What to Inspect:**
- All critical and major dimensions (100% or sample)
- Cosmetic/visual (100%)
- Functional test (100% for safety-critical, sample for others)
- Material certification review (per lot)
- Packaging/labeling (100%)

## First Article Inspection (FAI)

**FAI Sample Size:**

```
AS9102 Requirement:
- Minimum 1 part (can be more if customer requires or process validation needs)
- Part must be from production process, tooling, materials (not prototype)
- Part may be serialized "FAI-001" or selected from early production

Industry Practice:
- Aerospace: 1-3 parts typical
- Automotive PPAP: 300 parts minimum (for Cpk study)
- Medical: 3-30 parts (per validation requirements, risk-based)
```

### PPAP (Production Part Approval Process) - Automotive

**PPAP Sampling Requirements (AIAG):**

**Dimensional Results (Element 9):**

```
Minimum Sample: 300 consecutive parts from production run

Measurement:
- 100% of dimensions: Measure on ALL 300 parts
- Or statistically valid sample: e.g., 10 parts fully measured, 290 parts key dimensions only (if customer approves)

Purpose: Demonstrate process capability (Cpk >1.67 short-term)
```

**Initial Process Study (Element 11):**

```
Cpk Calculation from 300-part sample:

For each characteristic:
1. Measure 300 parts
2. Divide into 60 subgroups of 5 parts each (n=5, k=60)
3. Calculate X-bar (average) and R (range) for each subgroup
4. Calculate overall mean (X-double-bar) and mean range (R-bar)
5. Calculate sigma (std dev) = R-bar / d2 (d2 = 2.326 for n=5)
6. Calculate Cpk = min( (USL - mean) / 3σ, (mean - LSL) / 3σ )

Acceptance: Cpk ≥1.67 required for PPAP approval
```

**Example: Connecting Rod Center-to-Center Distance**

```
Specification: 6.000 ±0.002" (LSL 5.998", USL 6.002")
Sample: 300 parts measured

Results:
Mean (X-double-bar): 6.0000"
Sigma (short-term): 0.00040"

Cpk Calculation:
Cpu = (6.002 - 6.000) / (3 × 0.00040) = 0.002 / 0.0012 = 1.67
Cpl = (6.000 - 5.998) / (3 × 0.00040) = 0.002 / 0.0012 = 1.67
Cpk = min(1.67, 1.67) = 1.67

Result: ACCEPT (Cpk 1.67 meets minimum requirement)
```

## Measurement Systems Analysis (MSA)

### Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility (GR&R)

**Purpose:** Quantify variation in measurement system (gage + operator + environment).

**GR&R Study Design:**

```
AIAG Recommended Study:
- Parts: 10 parts representing process variation (select across tolerance range)
- Operators (Appraisers): 3 operators
- Trials: 3 measurements per part per operator
- Total Measurements: 10 parts × 3 operators × 3 trials = 90 measurements
```

**GR&R Components:**

| Variation Source | Symbol | Definition | Causes |
|-----------------|--------|------------|--------|
| **Repeatability** | EV (Equipment Variation) | Variation when same operator measures same part multiple times | Gage itself (resolution, calibration, stability) |
| **Reproducibility** | AV (Appraiser Variation) | Variation between different operators measuring same part | Operator technique, training, interpretation |
| **Part-to-Part** | PV (Part Variation) | Variation between different parts | Actual process variation (what we want to detect) |
| **Total Variation** | TV | Combined variation (EV + AV + PV) | All sources combined |

**GR&R Calculation (ANOVA Method - Preferred):**

```
Software (Minitab, JMP, etc.) calculates:

%EV = (EV / TV) × 100% (Repeatability as % of total)
%AV = (AV / TV) × 100% (Reproducibility as % of total)
%GR&R = (√(EV² + AV²) / TV) × 100% (Total gage variation)

Number of Distinct Categories (ndc):
ndc = (PV / GR&R) × 1.41

Interpretation:
ndc ≥5: Gage can distinguish at least 5 distinct categories (acceptable)
ndc <5: Gage resolution insufficient for application
```

**GR&R Acceptance Criteria:**

| %GR&R | Number of Distinct Categories | Assessment | Action |
|-------|------------------------------|------------|--------|
| **<10%** | >8 | Excellent | Accept gage |
| **10-30%** | 5-8 | Acceptable | Accept gage, monitor |
| **>30%** | <5 | Unacceptable | Reject gage, improve or replace |

**Example GR&R Study:**

```
Part: Hydraulic Valve Bore Diameter
Specification: Ø 0.7500 ±0.0010" (0.7490-0.7510")
Tolerance: 0.0020"
Gage: Air gage (Marposs E9C), resolution 0.00005"

Study Results (ANOVA):
Total Variation (TV): 0.00090"
Gage R&R: 0.00015"
Part Variation (PV): 0.00089"

%GR&R = (0.00015 / 0.00090) × 100% = 16.7% (Acceptable)
ndc = (0.00089 / 0.00015) × 1.41 = 8.4 (Acceptable, >5)

Conclusion: Air gage acceptable for this application (16.7% < 30%, ndc > 5)

Breakdown:
%EV (Repeatability): 14.2% (good, gage itself stable)
%AV (Reproducibility): 8.1% (good, operators consistent)
```

**When GR&R Fails (%GR&R >30%):**

| Root Cause | Solution | Expected Improvement |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Poor Gage Resolution** | Upgrade to higher-resolution gage (0.0001" → 0.00005") | 30-50% reduction in %GR&R |
| **Gage Calibration Drift** | Calibrate gage, more frequent calibration cycle | 20-40% reduction |
| **Operator Technique Variation** | Training, visual aids, fixturing to reduce variation | 20-50% reduction in %AV |
| **Gage Wear or Damage** | Repair or replace worn components (air tips, contacts) | 30-60% reduction |
| **Environmental (Temperature)** | Climate-controlled inspection room, thermal soak parts | 10-30% reduction |

### Measurement Uncertainty and Guard Banding

**Measurement Uncertainty (U):** Range within which true value lies with specified confidence (typically 95%).

**Sources of Uncertainty:**

- Gage calibration uncertainty (from NIST traceable cert)
- Gage resolution (digital readout increment)
- Gage repeatability (from GR&R)
- Environmental effects (temperature, humidity)
- Operator technique
- Part setup/alignment

**Guard Banding:**

**Purpose:** Account for measurement uncertainty when making accept/reject decisions.

**Method:** Reduce acceptance limits by uncertainty to ensure parts are truly in tolerance.

```
Example:

Drawing Tolerance: Ø 1.000 ±0.002" (0.998-1.002")
Measurement Uncertainty (U95): ±0.0002" (from gage cert and GR&R)

Guard Band Calculation:
Decision Rule: Accept if measured value within guard-banded limits

Lower Guard Band: 0.998 + 0.0002 = 0.9982"
Upper Guard Band: 1.002 - 0.0002 = 1.0018"

Decision:
- Part measures 0.9979": REJECT (below 0.9982" guard band, might be 0.9977" actual)
- Part measures 0.9985": ACCEPT (within guard band, confident it's >0.998" actual)
- Part measures 1.0019": REJECT (above 1.0018" guard band, might be 1.0021" actual)
- Part measures 1.0010": ACCEPT (within guard band)
```

**Guard Band Impact:**

| Tolerance | Measurement Uncertainty | Guard Band Applied | Effective Tolerance | Rejection Rate Impact |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| ±0.005" | ±0.0002" | Yes | ±0.0048" (4% smaller) | +2-5% rejection (rejects borderline parts) |
| ±0.002" | ±0.0002" | Yes | ±0.0018" (10% smaller) | +5-12% rejection |
| ±0.001" | ±0.0002" | Yes | ±0.0008" (20% smaller) | +10-25% rejection (significant) |
| ±0.0005" | ±0.0002" | Yes | ±0.0003" (40% smaller) | +20-50% rejection (gage inadequate) |

**When Guard Banding Indicates Gage Inadequacy:**

If guard band reduces tolerance >20%, gage uncertainty too large for application:
- **Upgrade Gage:** Higher resolution, better calibration, improved GR&R
- **Tighten Process:** Improve Cpk so parts stay well within tolerance (less borderline parts)

## Process Capability Analysis

### Capability Indices (Cp, Cpk, Pp, Ppk)

**Cp and Cpk (Process Capability - Short-Term):**

```
Cp = (USL - LSL) / (6σ_short-term)
Cpk = min( (USL - Mean) / 3σ, (Mean - LSL) / 3σ )

Where:
σ_short-term = R-bar / d2 (from control chart, within-subgroup variation)

Interpretation:
Cp: Potential capability if process perfectly centered
Cpk: Actual capability accounting for process centering
```

**Pp and Ppk (Process Performance - Long-Term):**

```
Pp = (USL - LSL) / (6σ_overall)
Ppk = min( (USL - Mean) / 3σ_overall, (Mean - LSL) / 3σ_overall )

Where:
σ_overall = standard deviation of ALL individual measurements (includes shift, drift over time)

Interpretation:
Pp: Potential performance if process perfectly centered
Ppk: Actual performance over time (includes all variation sources)
```

**Capability Requirements by Industry:**

| Industry | Minimum Cpk (Short-Term) | Minimum Ppk (Long-Term) | Application |
|----------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Aerospace (Safety of Flight)** | 1.67-2.0 | 1.33-1.67 | Critical characteristics (AS9100D) |
| **Aerospace (Standard)** | 1.33-1.67 | 1.33 | Non-critical dimensions |
| **Automotive (PPAP)** | 1.67 | 1.33 | Special characteristics (IATF 16949) |
| **Automotive (Production)** | 1.33 | 1.33 | Standard characteristics |
| **Medical Devices (Critical)** | 1.67-2.0 | 1.33-1.67 | Safety, efficacy, regulatory validation |
| **Medical Devices (Standard)** | 1.33 | 1.33 | Non-critical features |
| **Industrial (Precision)** | 1.33 | 1.0-1.33 | General precision manufacturing |

**Defect Rates by Cpk:**

| Cpk | Defect Rate (PPM) | Sigma Level | Interpretation |
|-----|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| **0.33** | 317,300 PPM (31.7%) | 1σ | Unacceptable (1 in 3 defective) |
| **0.67** | 45,500 PPM (4.6%) | 2σ | Very poor (1 in 22 defective) |
| **1.00** | 2,700 PPM (0.27%) | 3σ | Marginally capable (1 in 370) |
| **1.33** | 63 PPM (0.0063%) | 4σ | Acceptable minimum (1 in 15,873) |
| **1.67** | 0.6 PPM (0.00006%) | 5σ | Good capability (1 in 1.7 million) |
| **2.00** | 0.002 PPM | 6σ | Excellent (1 in 500 million) |

**Example Capability Study:**

```
Part: Transmission Gear Tooth Profile
Specification: Profile tolerance 0.0010" (±0.0005" from nominal)
Sample: 125 parts, 25 subgroups of 5 parts

Data:
Mean: 0.0000" (perfectly centered on nominal)
R-bar (average range): 0.00020"
σ_short-term = 0.00020 / 2.326 = 0.000086"

Cp = 0.0010 / (6 × 0.000086) = 0.0010 / 0.000516 = 1.94 (excellent potential)
Cpk = min( (0.0005 - 0) / (3 × 0.000086), (0 - (-0.0005)) / (3 × 0.000086) )
    = min( 1.94, 1.94 ) = 1.94 (excellent actual capability)

Conclusion: Process exceeds 1.67 requirement (Cpk 1.94), ACCEPT for production
Expected defects: ~0.002 PPM (essentially zero defects)
```

### Improving Process Capability

**When Cpk <1.33 (Unacceptable):**

| Issue | Root Cause | Solution | Expected Cpk Improvement |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------------------|
| **High Variation (Cp low)** | Process inherently variable | Upgrade equipment, better tooling, reduce tool wear | Cp: 1.0 → 1.5+ |
| **Off-Center (Cp good, Cpk low)** | Process mean not centered on target | Adjust process (offset, setup), use feedback control | Cpk: 1.0 → 1.5+ (no change in Cp) |
| **Unstable Process** | Out-of-control signals, shifts, trends | SPC monitoring, root cause analysis, eliminate special causes | Cpk: 0.8 → 1.3+ |
| **Mixed Populations** | Multiple machines, operators, lots mixed | Separate analysis by source, identify and fix worst performer | Cpk: 1.0 → 1.4+ |
| **Measurement Error** | GR&R >30%, gage inadequate | Upgrade measurement system (see MSA section) | Cpk: 1.0 → 1.2+ (appears better with better gage) |

**Cp vs. Cpk Interpretation:**

```
Scenario 1: Cp = 1.8, Cpk = 1.7
- Process highly capable AND well-centered
- Action: Maintain process, monitor for shifts

Scenario 2: Cp = 1.8, Cpk = 1.0
- Process capable (low variation) BUT off-center
- Action: Adjust process mean to center (easy fix, no capital investment)

Scenario 3: Cp = 0.9, Cpk = 0.9
- Process incapable (high variation) AND centered
- Action: Reduce variation (difficult, may require new equipment, better tooling)

Scenario 4: Cp = 0.9, Cpk = 0.6
- Process incapable (high variation) AND off-center (worst case)
- Action: 1) Center process (quick win), 2) Reduce variation (long-term solution)
```

## Conclusion

Inspection planning and quality control form the foundation of precision manufacturing, ensuring parts meet specifications, processes remain in control, and customers receive zero-defect products. From first article inspection (AS9102, PPAP) validating new processes to statistical process control (SPC) monitoring production and measurement systems analysis (MSA) ensuring gage capability, comprehensive inspection strategies prevent defects, reduce scrap, and provide objective evidence of quality.

Success in inspection planning requires understanding control plan development, sampling strategies, capability analysis (Cpk >1.33-1.67), measurement systems analysis (GR&R <30%), and industry-specific requirements (AS9100D aerospace, IATF 16949 automotive, 21 CFR 820 medical devices). Properly planned and executed inspection programs achieve defect rates <63 PPM (0.0063%), ensure regulatory compliance, and build customer confidence.
