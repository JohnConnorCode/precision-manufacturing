# FMEA Guide: Failure Mode and Effects Analysis for Manufacturing Quality

## Introduction

Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a systematic, proactive methodology for identifying potential failures in products and processes before they occur, enabling organizations to prioritize risk reduction activities and improve quality, reliability, and safety. Originally developed by the U.S. military in the 1940s and adopted by aerospace in the 1960s, FMEA has become a cornerstone quality tool required by ISO 9001, AS9100D, IATF 16949 (automotive), and FDA medical device regulations. Over 85% of aerospace and automotive manufacturers utilize FMEA as a core quality planning tool, with documented failure cost reductions of 30-70% when implemented effectively.

**What You'll Learn in This Guide:**
- Comprehensive overview of Process FMEA (PFMEA) and Design FMEA (DFMEA) methodologies
- AIAG-VDA FMEA Handbook (2019) standardized approach and updates from previous methodologies
- Severity, Occurrence, and Detection rating scales with manufacturing-specific examples
- Risk Priority Number (RPN) and Action Priority (AP) calculations and threshold criteria
- Step-by-step FMEA development process with real manufacturing case studies
- Risk reduction strategies and effective corrective action planning

## FMEA Fundamentals and Types

### What is FMEA?

**FMEA Definition:**
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis is a structured approach to:
1. **Identify** potential failure modes in a design or process
2. **Assess** the risk associated with those failures (severity, likelihood, detectability)
3. **Prioritize** actions to reduce or eliminate the risk
4. **Document** knowledge and corrective actions for continuous improvement

**Key Benefits:**

| Benefit Category | Specific Benefits | Quantifiable Impact |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Cost Reduction** | Prevent failures before production, reduce scrap/rework | 30-70% reduction in failure costs |
| **Quality Improvement** | Systematic risk identification, reduced defects | 40-60% reduction in customer complaints |
| **Safety Enhancement** | Identify and mitigate safety hazards proactively | Eliminate critical safety risks |
| **Knowledge Capture** | Document tribal knowledge, standardize best practices | Improved training, reduced variation |
| **Compliance** | Meet ISO 9001, AS9100D, IATF 16949, FDA requirements | Audit readiness, certification maintenance |
| **Customer Satisfaction** | Deliver more reliable products, fewer field failures | Improved warranty performance, reputation |

### FMEA Types

**Process FMEA (PFMEA):**
- **Focus:** Manufacturing and assembly processes
- **Objective:** Ensure process can consistently produce parts meeting specifications
- **When:** Before launch of new/changed process, ongoing review (annual or when changes occur)
- **Scope:** Process steps, equipment, tooling, methods, materials, environment
- **Typical Application:** CNC machining processes, assembly operations, welding, heat treatment

**Design FMEA (DFMEA):**
- **Focus:** Product design and functionality
- **Objective:** Ensure design meets customer requirements and avoids failure modes
- **When:** During product development, before design release
- **Scope:** Component functions, interfaces, material selection, design features
- **Typical Application:** Component design, systems engineering, product architecture

**Other FMEA Types:**

| FMEA Type | Focus | Typical Users | Application Example |

## AIAG-VDA FMEA Methodology (2019 Standard)

### Seven-Step FMEA Process

The AIAG-VDA FMEA Handbook (first edition 2019) harmonized U.S. automotive (AIAG) and German automotive (VDA) approaches, establishing a global standard. The methodology consists of seven steps organized into three phases:

**Phase 1: Planning and Preparation (Steps 1-2)**
**Phase 2: Analysis (Steps 3-5)**
**Phase 3: Risk Reduction and Results Documentation (Steps 6-7)**

**Seven Steps Overview:**

| Step | Name | Key Activities | Deliverable |
|------|------|----------------|-------------|
| **1** | Planning and Preparation | Define scope, assemble team, define objectives | FMEA project plan |
| **2** | Structure Analysis | Create process flow diagram, identify functions | Process structure |
| **3** | Function Analysis | Define requirements for each process step | Function requirements |
| **4** | Failure Analysis | Identify failure modes, effects, causes | Failure chain |
| **5** | Risk Analysis | Rate Severity, Occurrence, Detection; calculate AP | Risk assessment |
| **6** | Optimization | Define and implement actions to reduce risk | Action plan |
| **7** | Results Documentation | Document results, lessons learned, continuous improvement | Final FMEA document |

### Key Changes from Traditional FMEA

**AIAG-VDA vs. Traditional AIAG 4th Edition:**

| Aspect | Traditional FMEA (AIAG 4th) | AIAG-VDA FMEA (2019) | Significance |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Risk Metric** | RPN (Risk Priority Number) | **AP (Action Priority)** | AP focuses on high-severity items first |
| **Calculation** | RPN = S × O × D (1-1000) | AP based on S-O-D tables | More nuanced prioritization |
| **Severity Focus** | Equal weight to S, O, D | **Severity-first approach** | Safety and critical functions prioritized |
| **Structure Analysis** | Often skipped or informal | **Required Step 2** | Systematic process understanding |
| **Function Analysis** | Minimal focus | **Required Step 3** | Clear requirements definition |
| **Failure Chain** | Simple cause-effect | **Detailed failure chain** | Better root cause understanding |
| **Documentation** | Variable formats | **Standardized forms and structure** | Consistency across organizations |

**Why Action Priority (AP) Replaced RPN:**

**RPN Limitations:**
- High RPN doesn't necessarily indicate highest risk (e.g., S=5, O=9, D=9 gives RPN=405, but S=9, O=5, D=5 gives RPN=225)
- Severity of 9-10 (safety/regulatory) should always be prioritized regardless of RPN value
- Equal weighting of S, O, D doesn't reflect true risk (severity should dominate)

**AP Advantages:**
- Severity-first: High severity (9-10) automatically triggers action regardless of O or D
- Nuanced: Looks at combinations of S-O-D, not just multiplication
- Clear thresholds: Defined action priorities (High, Medium, Low) guide resource allocation

### AIAG-VDA Rating Scales

**Severity (S) Rating: Seriousness of Effect to Customer/End User**

| Rating | Severity | Effect on Customer | Manufacturing Example | Criteria |
|--------|----------|-------------------|----------------------|----------|
| **10** | Hazard - No Warning | Safety risk, non-compliance, no warning | Brake component fracture, immediate failure | Regulatory violation, safety hazard |
| **9** | Hazard - With Warning | Safety risk with warning, serious non-compliance | Critical dimension out of spec, detected before use | Safety risk, government regulation |
| **8** | Very High | Product inoperable, loss of primary function | Part doesn't fit assembly, major rework | Primary function lost |
| **7** | High | Product performance degraded, customer dissatisfied | Cosmetic defect on visible surface (Class A) | Reduced performance, customer very dissatisfied |
| **6** | Moderate | Product performance degraded, customer somewhat dissatisfied | Minor cosmetic defect, functional but noticeable | Comfort/convenience affected |
| **5** | Low | Product performance slightly affected | Dimension at tolerance limit, still acceptable | Fit/finish/noise item noticed by discriminating customer |
| **4** | Very Low | Minor effect, noticed by most customers | Minor burr, slight surface roughness variation | Defect noticed by average customer |
| **3** | Minor | Very minor effect, noticed by discriminating customers | Very minor cosmetic variation | Defect noticed by discriminating customer only |
| **2** | Very Minor | Very minor effect, difficult to notice | Slight variation in non-critical dimension | Defect very difficult to notice |
| **1** | None | No effect | No discernible effect on customer | No effect on product or customer |

**Key Rule: Severity is based on the effect to the customer/end user, not the manufacturing organization. It cannot be reduced by process controls; only design changes can reduce severity.**

**Occurrence (O) Rating: Likelihood of Failure Cause Happening**

| Rating | Occurrence Likelihood | Frequency | Cpk | PPM | Manufacturing Example |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|-----|-----|----------------------|
| **10** | Extremely High | ≥1 in 2 | <0.55 | >100,000 | New untested process, no controls |
| **9** | Very High | 1 in 3 | 0.55-0.78 | 50,000 | Process frequently produces defects |
| **8** | High | 1 in 8 | 0.78-0.86 | 20,000 | Process occasionally produces defects |
| **7** | Moderately High | 1 in 20 | 0.86-0.94 | 10,000 | Manual process with moderate controls |
| **6** | Moderate | 1 in 80 | 0.94-1.00 | 2,000 | Manual process with good controls |
| **5** | Low | 1 in 400 | 1.00-1.10 | 500 | Stable process, periodic defects |
| **4** | Very Low | 1 in 2,000 | 1.10-1.20 | 200 | Capable process with good controls |
| **3** | Minor | 1 in 15,000 | 1.20-1.30 | 50 | Highly capable process, rare defects |
| **2** | Very Minor | 1 in 150,000 | 1.30-1.67 | 10 | Near-perfect process with multiple controls |
| **1** | Remote | <1 in 1,500,000 | >1.67 | <1 | Proven process, defects nearly impossible |

**Occurrence can be reduced by:**
- Improving process capability (increasing Cpk)
- Eliminating root causes through process changes
- Mistake-proofing (poka-yoke) devices
- Automation to eliminate human error
- Statistical Process Control (SPC) with corrective actions

**Detection (D) Rating: Likelihood of Detecting Failure Before It Reaches Customer**

| Rating | Detection Likelihood | Control Type | Manufacturing Example | Effectiveness |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|----------------------|---------------|
| **10** | Absolute Uncertainty | No control, cannot detect | No inspection, reliance on chance | 0% detection |
| **9** | Very Remote | Indirect control, random sampling <1% | Random visual check, 1 in 500 parts | <10% detection |
| **8** | Remote | Visual inspection, sampling 1-5% | Visual inspection sample, 1 in 100 | 10-30% detection |
| **7** | Very Low | Visual inspection, sampling 5-20% | Visual inspection, 1 in 10 | 30-50% detection |
| **6** | Low | Manual measurement, sampling | CMM sample inspection, 10% of parts | 50-70% detection |
| **5** | Moderate | Manual gage, 100% inspection (human) | 100% manual gage check (human error possible) | 70-85% detection |
| **4** | Moderately High | Attribute gage, automated check (sample) | Go/no-go gage, vision system (sample) | 85-95% detection |
| **3** | High | Automated inspection, 100% (non-destructive) | Automated vision system 100% of parts | 95-98% detection |
| **2** | Very High | Error-proofing that prevents defect from occurring | Part won't load if dimension wrong (poka-yoke) | 98-99.5% detection |
| **1** | Almost Certain | Defect prevented by design or process | Wrong part physically cannot be loaded | >99.5% detection (defect prevented) |

**Detection can be improved by:**
- Implementing 100% automated inspection (vision, laser, CMM)
- Adding SPC monitoring with immediate feedback
- Error-proofing (poka-yoke) to prevent defects from being created
- Improving gage R&R (measurement system capability)
- Adding multiple verification points in process

## Action Priority (AP) Determination

### AIAG-VDA Action Priority Tables

**Action Priority is determined by evaluating Severity first, then looking at the combination of Occurrence and Detection.**

**AP Table for High Severity (S = 9-10):**

| Severity | Occurrence | Detection | Action Priority |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **9-10** | Any | Any | **High (H)** |

**Key Rule:** Any failure mode with Severity 9-10 automatically receives High Action Priority and requires action, regardless of Occurrence or Detection ratings.

**AP Table for Moderate-High Severity (S = 5-8):**

| Severity | Occurrence | Detection 1-3 | Detection 4-6 | Detection 7-10 |
|----------|-----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| **7-8** | 7-10 | High (H) | High (H) | High (H) |
| **7-8** | 4-6 | High (H) | Medium (M) | Medium (M) |
| **7-8** | 1-3 | Medium (M) | Low (L) | Low (L) |
| **5-6** | 7-10 | High (H) | Medium (M) | Medium (M) |
| **5-6** | 4-6 | Medium (M) | Medium (M) | Low (L) |
| **5-6** | 1-3 | Low (L) | Low (L) | Low (L) |

**AP Table for Low Severity (S = 1-4):**

| Severity | Occurrence | Detection | Action Priority |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **1-4** | 8-10 | 8-10 | Medium (M) |
| **1-4** | 8-10 | 1-7 | Low (L) |
| **1-4** | 1-7 | Any | Low (L) |

**Action Priority Definitions:**

| Priority | Action Required | Timeline | Resources | Example Thresholds |
|----------|----------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **High (H)** | Immediate action required before production | Before production launch or immediately | Senior management approval, dedicated resources | S≥9, or high S-O-D combinations |
| **Medium (M)** | Action should be planned and implemented | Within 3-6 months or next model year | Engineering resources, planned budget | Moderate S-O-D combinations |
| **Low (L)** | Action may be considered for continuous improvement | Ongoing, as resources permit | Continuous improvement activities | Low S-O-D combinations |

### RPN (Risk Priority Number) - Legacy Metric

While AIAG-VDA FMEA emphasizes Action Priority, RPN is still calculated and monitored:

**RPN = Severity (S) × Occurrence (O) × Detection (D)**

**RPN Range:** 1 to 1000

**Traditional RPN Thresholds (organization-specific, examples):**

| RPN Range | Risk Level | Action | Typical Organizational Response |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------------------------------|
| **200-1000** | High Risk | Immediate action required | Must reduce before production |
| **100-199** | Moderate Risk | Action should be planned | Address within 6 months |
| **40-99** | Low-Moderate Risk | Action may be considered | Continuous improvement opportunity |
| **1-39** | Low Risk | Monitor, no immediate action | Acceptable risk |

**Note:** RPN thresholds vary by industry and organization. Aerospace may use threshold of 100, automotive 125, medical device 80. **Always prioritize based on Action Priority (AP) per AIAG-VDA, not RPN alone.**

**RPN Example Comparison:**

| Failure Mode | S | O | D | RPN | AP | Which to Prioritize? |
|--------------|---|---|---|-----|----|--------------------|
| **A: Critical fracture** | 10 | 2 | 7 | 140 | **High** | **Prioritize A (safety critical)** |
| **B: Cosmetic defect** | 4 | 9 | 9 | 324 | Low | RPN would suggest B, but AP correctly prioritizes A |

**Conclusion: Use Action Priority (AP) as primary decision tool, with RPN as secondary metric for tracking and trending.**

## Step-by-Step PFMEA Development Process

### Step 1: Planning and Preparation

**Define Scope:**
- **Process:** Which manufacturing process or operation? (e.g., "CNC Milling of Titanium Aerospace Bracket")
- **Boundaries:** Where does process start and end? (e.g., "From raw material receipt to final inspection")
- **Assumptions:** What is in-scope vs. out-of-scope? (e.g., "Incoming material inspection is separate FMEA")

**Assemble Cross-Functional Team:**

| Role | Responsibility | Typical Participant |
|------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Process Owner** | Owns process, implements actions | Manufacturing supervisor/manager |
| **Process Engineer** | Technical expertise on process | Manufacturing engineer |
| **Quality Engineer** | FMEA facilitation, risk assessment | Quality engineer (lead facilitator) |
| **Design Engineer** | Design intent, specifications | Product/design engineer |
| **Maintenance** | Equipment reliability, failure modes | Maintenance technician/supervisor |
| **Operator** | Hands-on knowledge, practical insights | Production operator (experienced) |

**Team Size:** 4-8 people (small enough to be efficient, large enough for diverse perspectives)

**Define Objectives:**
- **What are we trying to achieve?** (e.g., "Reduce scrap by 50%", "Eliminate safety risks", "Meet AS9100D requirements")
- **What are success criteria?** (e.g., "All High AP items addressed before production launch")

**Timeline:** Typical PFMEA development: 4-8 hours for moderately complex process (15-25 process steps), spread over 2-3 meetings

### Step 2: Structure Analysis - Process Flow Diagram

**Create Detailed Process Flow:**

**Example: CNC Machining of Aerospace Bracket (Simplified)**

```
1. Receive Raw Material (Ti-6Al-4V bar stock)
   ↓
2. Verify Material Certification (AMS 4928, chemistry, lot number)
   ↓
3. Cut to Length (band saw, 6.5" ±0.125")
   ↓
4. Load in CNC Mill (4-axis machining center, Kurt vise)
   ↓
5. Face Stock (OP10 - establish datum A)
   ↓
6. Rough Mill Contour (OP20 - 0.040" stock remaining)
   ↓
7. Flip Part, Secure in Fixture (OP30 - machine opposite side)
   ↓
8. Finish Mill All Faces (OP40 - final dimensions ±0.002")
   ↓
9. Drill Mounting Holes (OP50 - 0.250" diameter, 4 places)
   ↓
10. Deburr (Manual, abrasive pads, 0.005-0.015" chamfer)
   ↓
11. Clean (Aqueous cleaning tank, 10 min cycle)
   ↓
12. Inspect (CMM, 100% dimensional inspection per print)
   ↓
13. Package (Individual VCI bag, foam protection)
```

**Structure Analysis Deliverable:** Process flow diagram with clear process steps, decision points, and rework loops identified.

### Step 3: Function Analysis - Requirements for Each Step

**For each process step, define:**
- **Function:** What is the step supposed to do?
- **Requirements:** What are the specifications/criteria?

**Example: Step 8 - Finish Mill All Faces**

| Process Step | Function | Requirements |
|--------------|----------|--------------|
| **8. Finish Mill All Faces (OP40)** | Machine all faces to final dimension and surface finish | - Dimension: 4.500" ±0.002" (length), 3.250" ±0.002" (width), 0.625" ±0.001" (thickness)<br>- Surface finish: Ra 63 μin max<br>- Parallelism: 0.002" total<br>- No tool marks, scratches, or damage<br>- Cycle time: <12 minutes |

### Step 4: Failure Analysis - Identify Failure Modes, Effects, and Causes

**For each process step function, identify:**

**Failure Chain: Failure Cause → Failure Mode → Failure Effect**

**Example: Step 8 - Finish Mill All Faces**

| Failure Cause | Failure Mode | Local Effect | End Effect (Customer Impact) |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| **Tool wear (dull insert)** | Dimension out of tolerance (oversize by 0.005") | Part scrapped or rework required | Part doesn't fit assembly, production delay |
| **Incorrect offset** | Dimension undersized by 0.010" | Part scrapped (can't add material) | Part rejected, delivery delay, customer complaint |
| **Coolant contamination (low concentration)** | Poor surface finish (Ra 125 μin vs. 63 max) | Part requires rework (polishing) or scrap | Cosmetic defect, reduced fatigue life |
| **Vibration (loose fixture)** | Chatter marks, poor finish, dimension variation | Part scrap or rework | Functional failure, customer rejection |
| **Wrong program loaded** | Wrong part machined (incorrect geometry) | Part scrapped, potential safety issue | Wrong part shipped to customer, safety risk |

### Step 5: Risk Analysis - Rate S-O-D and Determine Action Priority

**For each failure mode, rate Severity, Occurrence, Detection:**

**Example: Finish Mill All Faces - Dimension Out of Tolerance (Oversize)**

| Failure Mode | Severity (S) | Justification | Occurrence (O) | Justification | Current Controls | Detection (D) | Justification | AP | RPN |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|--------------|---------------|----|----|
| **Dimension oversize by 0.005"** | **7** | Part doesn't fit assembly, major rework or scrap, customer very dissatisfied | **4** | Occurs 1 in 2000 parts (tool wear monitoring, Cpk=1.15) | Tool life monitoring (500 parts), operator check first/last part | **3** | 100% CMM inspection catches defect before shipment (automated) | **Medium** | **84** |

**Current Controls Documented:**
- **Prevention Controls (reduce Occurrence):** Tool life monitoring, preventive tool change at 500 parts, SPC on critical dimensions
- **Detection Controls (reduce Detection):** First-piece inspection, last-piece inspection, 100% CMM dimensional inspection

**Recommended Actions (for Medium or High AP):**
- Implement automated in-process measurement (reduce Detection to 2)
- Increase tool change frequency to 400 parts based on SPC data (reduce Occurrence to 3)
- Add vibration monitoring to detect tool wear earlier (reduce Occurrence to 3)

### Step 6: Optimization - Action Planning

**For each High or Medium Action Priority item, define actions:**

**Action Plan Template:**

| Failure Mode | Current AP | Recommended Action | Responsibility | Target Completion | Expected Impact |
|--------------|-----------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Dimension oversize due to tool wear** | Medium (S7-O4-D3) | 1. Install in-process laser measurement system<br>2. Reduce tool change interval from 500 to 400 parts<br>3. Implement SPC with automatic alerts | Manufacturing Engineer: J. Smith<br>Maintenance: R. Jones<br>Quality: A. Lee | 1. 2024-04-30<br>2. 2024-03-15<br>3. 2024-04-15 | Target AP: Low<br>S=7 (unchanged)<br>O=3 (improved)<br>D=2 (improved)<br>New RPN: 42 |

**Action Effectiveness Verification:**
- **Before Implementation:** S=7, O=4, D=3, RPN=84, AP=Medium
- **After Implementation:** S=7, O=3, D=2, RPN=42, AP=Low
- **Verification Method:** Monitor defect rate for 3 months post-implementation, target <50 PPM (O=3 confirmed)

For continuous improvement strategies, see our [Design for Manufacturability Guide](/resources/design-for-manufacturability-guide).

### Step 7: Results Documentation

**Final FMEA Document Includes:**
- **Header Information:** Part/process name, FMEA team, date, revision history
- **Structure Analysis:** Process flow diagram
- **FMEA Worksheet:** All process steps, failure modes, S-O-D ratings, AP, current controls, actions
- **Action Plan Summary:** High/Medium AP items with action status
- **Lessons Learned:** Key insights for future FMEAs
- **Approval Signatures:** Process owner, quality manager, program manager

**FMEA Maintenance:**
- **Review Frequency:** Annually or when process changes (new equipment, new material, engineering change)
- **Updates:** Add new failure modes discovered in production, update S-O-D after process improvements
- **Living Document:** FMEA should evolve with the process, not a one-time exercise

For traceability and documentation systems, see our [Traceability & Documentation Systems](/resources/traceability-documentation-systems).

**Actions Taken and Results:**

| Action | Cost | Implementation Time | Result (after 6 months) | Risk Reduction |
|--------|------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Automated in-line air gage with auto-reject** | $18,000 (equipment) + $2,500 (installation) | 6 weeks | Detection improved from D=4 to D=2 (99%+ effective), zero defects escaped to customer | RPN: 180 → 54 (70% reduction) |

## FMEA Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### Best Practices

**1. Engage the Right Team:**
- Include operators (hands-on knowledge) and maintenance (failure history)
- Avoid "desk FMEA" - go to the gemba (shop floor) to observe process
- Cross-functional diversity brings different perspectives

**2. Focus on High-Severity Items First:**
- Severity 9-10 items require action regardless of Occurrence or Detection
- Don't get distracted by high RPN but low severity items
- Safety and regulatory compliance must be prioritized

**3. Use Data to Rate Occurrence:**
- Don't guess - use SPC data, Cpk values, defect rates, historical scrap/rework
- If no data, conduct process capability study before finalizing FMEA
- Occurrence rating should be defendable with evidence

**4. Be Realistic About Detection:**
- 100% manual inspection is not D=1 (human error exists, typically D=5)
- Visual inspection is inherently unreliable (D=7-9 depending on sampling)
- Only error-proofing that prevents defect creation or automated rejection earns D=1-2

**5. Define Specific Actions with Accountability:**
- Vague actions like "improve training" or "monitor closely" are ineffective
- Specific: "Install torque-limited driver preset to 25 in-lbs by J. Smith by 2024-04-15"
- Assign single person responsible (not a team), set target date, verify completion

**6. Verify Action Effectiveness:**
- After implementing action, re-rate S-O-D to confirm improvement
- Collect data to validate new Occurrence and Detection ratings
- If action didn't work, try different approach - FMEA is iterative

**7. Treat FMEA as Living Document:**
- Update when process changes (new equipment, tooling, operator, material)
- Add newly discovered failure modes from production (lessons learned)
- Annual review minimum, more frequent for critical processes

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Description | Impact | How to Avoid |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| **"Desk FMEA" (No Gemba)** | FMEA created in conference room without observing actual process | Misses real failure modes, unrealistic ratings | Conduct FMEA sessions at the process, observe multiple cycles |
| **Copying Old FMEAs** | Copy-paste from previous FMEA without critical review | Irrelevant failure modes, outdated controls, no value added | Start fresh for new processes, critically review every line for existing processes |
| **Focusing Only on RPN** | Prioritize actions based on RPN alone, ignore severity | Safety/critical items with low RPN ignored | Use Action Priority (AP) per AIAG-VDA, severity-first approach |
| **Unrealistic Detection Ratings** | Rate manual inspection as D=1-2, overestimate control effectiveness | False confidence, defects escape to customer | Be conservative, use measurement system analysis (MSA) data, gage R&R |
| **No Action Follow-Up** | Identify actions but never implement or verify | FMEA becomes paperwork exercise, no actual risk reduction | Assign ownership, track actions in project management system, report status at quality reviews |
| **Too Generic** | Failure modes like "defect" or "error" with no specificity | Impossible to identify root causes or effective actions | Be specific: "Dimension 0.250" diameter undersize by >0.0003" due to tool wear" |
| **Severity Based on Internal Impact** | Rate severity based on scrap cost to company, not customer impact | Misses safety/regulatory risks, wrong prioritization | Always rate severity from customer/end-user perspective per AIAG-VDA definition |
| **Solo FMEA** | One person creates FMEA alone | Limited perspective, misses failure modes, low buy-in | Require cross-functional team, minimum 4 people including operator and quality |

## Integration with Quality Systems

### FMEA Requirements in Standards

**ISO 9001:2015:**
- **Clause 6.1:** Risk-based thinking throughout the QMS
- **Clause 8.3.3:** Design and development outputs - consideration of potential failure modes
- **Clause 8.5.1:** Control of production - planned arrangements to address risks
- **Note:** ISO 9001 doesn't mandate FMEA by name, but FMEA is the most common tool to demonstrate risk-based thinking

**AS9100D (Aerospace):**
- **Clause 8.1.1:** Operational planning and control - risk management for products and processes
- **Clause 8.3.4.3:** Design and development outputs - specific requirement for DFMEA
- **Clause 8.5.1.2:** Control of production process changes - PFMEA for process changes
- **Interpretation:** AS9100D requires FMEA for aerospace manufacturing

**IATF 16949:2016 (Automotive):**
- **Clause 8.3.5.1:** Mandatory requirement for DFMEA
- **Clause 8.5.1.1:** Mandatory requirement for PFMEA (control plan based on PFMEA)
- **Clause 8.5.1.2:** Standardized work - instructions derived from PFMEA
- **Interpretation:** FMEA is mandatory for automotive tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers

**FDA 21 CFR Part 820 (Medical Devices):**
- **820.30(g):** Design validation - risk analysis required
- **ISO 14971:** Medical device risk management standard (often cited alongside FDA)
- **Note:** While FDA doesn't require FMEA specifically, it's the most common risk analysis method for medical device manufacturers

For AS9100D compliance, see our [AS9100D Compliance Checklist](/resources/as9100d-compliance-checklist).

### FMEA Relationship to Control Plans

**PFMEA and Control Plan Integration:**

The PFMEA directly drives the Control Plan, which defines inspection and monitoring activities:

**Control Plan Elements Derived from PFMEA:**

| FMEA Output | Control Plan Input | Example |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| **High Severity (S≥9)** | Special Characteristics (critical, key) | Dimension 0.250" ±0.0002" flagged as Critical (⟐) requires 100% inspection |
| **Current Detection Controls** | Inspection method, frequency, sample size | CMM inspection, 100%, air gage with SPC |
| **Process Capability (Cpk from Occurrence)** | Reaction plan when Cpk drops below target | If Cpk <1.33, increase sampling to 100%, investigate root cause |
| **Recommended Actions** | Preventive maintenance, tool change intervals | Tool change every 300 parts, verified by SPC data |

**Control Plan Special Characteristics Designation:**

| FMEA Severity | Control Plan Designation | Symbol | Inspection Requirement |
|---------------|-------------------------|--------|------------------------|
| **S = 9-10** | Critical Characteristic | ⟐ (diamond) | 100% inspection, cannot ship with defect, documented evidence required |
| **S = 7-8** | Key/Significant Characteristic | ▲ (triangle) or ⬣ (hexagon) | Enhanced controls, increased sampling (often 100%), SPC monitored |
| **S = 5-6** | Standard Characteristic | None | Normal sampling per inspection plan |
| **S = 1-4** | Standard Characteristic | None | Periodic sampling or visual check |

## Conclusion

Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a powerful proactive quality tool that systematically identifies potential failures, assesses risk, and prioritizes actions to prevent defects before they reach customers. Effective FMEA implementation requires cross-functional collaboration, data-driven risk assessment, and disciplined follow-through on corrective actions. Success depends on understanding:

- **AIAG-VDA Methodology:** Seven-step structured approach with Action Priority (AP) replacing traditional RPN for better risk prioritization
- **Severity-First Approach:** High severity (S≥9) items require action regardless of Occurrence or Detection ratings
- **Data-Driven Ratings:** Use Cpk, defect rates, and measurement system capability to establish realistic Occurrence and Detection ratings
- **Specific Actions:** Define clear actions with single-point accountability, target dates, and effectiveness verification
- **Living Document:** FMEA must be updated when processes change and should capture lessons learned from production

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Action Priority (AP) Replaces RPN:** AIAG-VDA 2019 methodology prioritizes based on severity-first combinations, not simple S×O×D multiplication
2. **Severity 9-10 Always High Priority:** Safety and regulatory compliance issues require immediate action regardless of likelihood or detection
3. **Realistic Detection Ratings:** 100% manual inspection is D=5 (not D=1), visual inspection is D=7-9, only error-proofing earns D=1-2
4. **Team-Based Process:** Cross-functional team with operators, engineers, quality, and maintenance provides best failure mode identification
5. **Verify Action Effectiveness:** After implementing corrective actions, re-rate S-O-D with data to confirm risk reduction
6. **Integrate with Control Plans:** FMEA outputs drive control plan inspection frequencies, special characteristics, and reaction plans
