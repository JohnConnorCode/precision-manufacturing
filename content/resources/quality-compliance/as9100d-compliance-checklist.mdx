# AS9100D Compliance Checklist for Aerospace Manufacturing

## Introduction

AS9100D is the international quality management standard specifically designed for the aerospace industry. This comprehensive compliance checklist helps you evaluate your readiness for AS9100D certification and maintain ongoing compliance. At IIS, we've maintained AS9100D certification since 2015, ensuring the highest quality standards for our aerospace customers.

**Why AS9100D Certification is Critical for Aerospace Manufacturing:**

- **Customer Requirements:** 95% of aerospace OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers require AS9100D certification as a condition of doing business (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Airbus, etc.)
- **Risk Reduction:** Structured approach reduces defect rates by 40-60% through systematic quality and risk management
- **Competitive Advantage:** Differentiates you from 70% of machine shops that lack aerospace certification
- **Continuous Improvement:** PDCA framework drives 15-25% year-over-year efficiency gains
- **Market Access:** Required for ITAR defense work and international aerospace contracts

## AS9100D Compliance Roadmap

Use this comprehensive checklist to track your AS9100D implementation progress. Each section corresponds to the AS9100D:2016 standard requirements. Mark items complete as you implement them in your quality management system.
