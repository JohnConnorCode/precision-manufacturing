# GD&T Geometric Tolerancing Complete Guide - ASME Y14.5-2018

## Introduction

Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) is the international language of precision manufacturing, providing an unambiguous method to define and communicate design intent, functional requirements, and inspection criteria. GD&T enables tighter functional control, larger tolerance zones, reduced scrap, and consistent interpretation between design, manufacturing, and quality organizations.

**Why GD&T is Essential in Precision Manufacturing:**

- **Functional Tolerancing:** Control what matters (form, orientation, location) not just size
- **Larger Tolerance Zones:** GD&T tolerance zones 57% larger than coordinate tolerancing (cylindrical vs. square)
- **Unambiguous Communication:** Single interpretation worldwide (eliminates "title block tolerance" ambiguity)
- **Datum Reference Frames:** Establish functional relationships between features
- **Material Condition Modifiers:** Bonus tolerance when features depart from worst-case (MMC, LMC)
- **Inspection Efficiency:** CMM programs directly implement GD&T callouts
- **Cost Reduction:** Larger tolerances = higher yields, lower manufacturing costs (15-30% typical)
- **Interchangeability:** Ensures parts assemble correctly 100% of the time (statistical tolerance analysis)

**GD&T Standards:**

- **ASME Y14.5-2018:** American standard (aerospace, defense, automotive, industrial)
- **ISO 1101:2017:** International standard (similar to ASME with minor differences)
- **ASME Y14.5M-1994:** Previous standard (still referenced in legacy drawings)

**Common GD&T Misconceptions:**

- GD&T does NOT make parts harder to manufacture (it clarifies what's actually required)
- GD&T is NOT just for aerospace (applicable to any precision assembly from medical devices to consumer products)
- GD&T does NOT replace size tolerances (it supplements them with geometric controls)
- ±0.005" coordinate tolerance ≠ 0.005" position tolerance (fundamentally different tolerance zones)

At IIS, we apply GD&T to 100% of our aerospace and medical device components, program CMM inspection per GD&T standards, and train our machinists in GD&T interpretation. This guide provides comprehensive GD&T knowledge per ASME Y14.5-2018 for design, manufacturing, and quality professionals.

## GD&T Fundamentals

### The 14 Geometric Tolerances

GD&T defines 14 geometric characteristics organized into five categories:

| Category | Symbol | Characteristic | Controls | Datum Required? |
|----------|--------|---------------|----------|----------------|
| **Form** | ⏤ | Straightness | Line elements of a surface or axis | No |
|  | ○ | Flatness | Entire surface | No |
|  | ○ | Circularity (Roundness) | Circular cross-section | No |
|  | ⌭ | Cylindricity | Entire cylindrical surface | No |
| **Profile** | ⌓ | Profile of a Line | 2D cross-section tolerance zone | Optional |
|  | ⌓ | Profile of a Surface | 3D surface tolerance zone | Optional |
| **Orientation** | ∕∕ | Parallelism | Parallel to datum | Yes |
|  | ⊥ | Perpendicularity | 90° to datum | Yes |
|  | ∠ | Angularity | Specific angle to datum | Yes |
| **Location** | ⌖ | Position | Location of feature(s) | Yes (usually) |
|  | ⌯ | Concentricity | Median points of cylinder/sphere | Yes |
|  | ↕ | Symmetry | Median points of feature | Yes |
| **Runout** | ↗ | Circular Runout | Circular element rotation | Yes |
|  | ⤢ | Total Runout | Entire surface rotation | Yes |

### Feature Control Frame Anatomy

**Example Feature Control Frame:**

```
┌───┬─────────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
│ ⌖ │ Ø 0.010 │ M │ A │ B │ C │
└───┴─────────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
  ↓      ↓       ↓    ↓   ↓   ↓
  │      │       │    │   │   └─ Tertiary datum
  │      │       │    │   └───── Secondary datum
  │      │       │    └───────── Primary datum
  │      │       └────────────── Material condition modifier (MMC)
  │      └────────────────────── Tolerance value (Ø = cylindrical zone)
  └───────────────────────────── Geometric characteristic symbol
```

**Reading this callout:**
"The axis of this feature shall be located within a cylindrical tolerance zone of diameter 0.010" at Maximum Material Condition (MMC), relative to datum reference frame A (primary), B (secondary), C (tertiary)."

### Datum Reference Frame

**Definition:** A datum reference frame (DRF) is a coordinate system established by datums that simulates the functional interface of a part in its assembly.

**The 3-2-1 Datum Scheme (Most Common):**

| Datum | Degrees of Freedom Constrained | Typical Feature Type | Physical Simulator |
|-------|-------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Primary (A)** | 3 DOF (rotation X, Y; translation Z) | Planar surface | Surface plate or planar locators |
| **Secondary (B)** | 2 DOF (rotation Z; translation Y) | Planar or cylindrical | Locator perpendicular to A |
| **Tertiary (C)** | 1 DOF (translation X) | Planar or cylindrical | Locator perpendicular to A and B |
| **Total** | 6 DOF fully constrained | N/A | Part cannot move in any direction |

**Example: Machined Block**

```
         ┌──────────────────┐
         │                  │ ← Datum A (primary): Large flat surface
         │                  │   Constrains 3 DOF (sits on surface plate)
         │        ●─────────┼─→ Datum B (secondary): Cylindrical hole
         │                  │   Constrains 2 DOF (pin inserted, part rotates to contact)
    ─────┼──────────────────┤
    ↑    │                  │
Datum C  │                  │
(tertiary)│                  │
Slot or  └──────────────────┘
feature constrains final 1 DOF (translation along B axis)
```

**Datum Precedence Matters:**

Changing datum order changes the functional relationship:

- **A|B|C:** Part sits on A, aligns with B, then C (most common for machined parts)
- **B|A|C:** Part locates on B (centerline), then A (clocking), then C (different functional intent)

**Rule:** Datum order must reflect actual assembly conditions and functional requirements.

### Material Condition Modifiers

Material condition modifiers (MMC, LMC) provide bonus tolerance when features depart from their worst-case size.

**Maximum Material Condition (MMC) - Ⓜ:**

**Definition:** The condition where a feature contains the maximum amount of material within the size limits.

| Feature Type | MMC Condition |
|--------------|---------------|
| **External (shaft, boss)** | Largest allowable diameter |
| **Internal (hole, slot)** | Smallest allowable diameter |

**Example: Hole Position with MMC**

```
Hole specification:
Diameter: Ø 0.250 ±0.005  (0.245-0.255 allowable)
Position: Ø 0.010 Ⓜ A|B|C

Bonus Tolerance Table:
┌─────────────┬──────────┬────────────┬───────────────┐
│ Actual Hole │ Deviation│  Bonus     │ Total Position│
│ Diameter    │ from MMC │ Tolerance  │ Tolerance     │
├─────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼───────────────┤
│ 0.245 (MMC) │ 0.000    │ 0.000      │ Ø 0.010       │
│ 0.250 (nom) │ 0.005    │ 0.005      │ Ø 0.015       │
│ 0.255 (LMC) │ 0.010    │ 0.010      │ Ø 0.020       │
└─────────────┴──────────┴────────────┴───────────────┘
```

**Why Use MMC:**
- **Manufacturing Flexibility:** Larger holes = more position tolerance (easier to meet)
- **Functional:** Ensures assembly (bolt clearance example: smaller hole must be more accurate for bolt to fit)
- **Cost Savings:** Parts at LMC easier to make, still functional

**Least Material Condition (LMC) - Ⓛ:**

**Definition:** The condition where a feature contains the minimum amount of material.

**Example Use:** Minimum wall thickness control

```
Hole in thin wall: Ø 0.500 +0.010/-0.000
Position: Ø 0.020 Ⓛ A

Ensures: As hole gets larger (LMC = 0.510), position tolerance reduces to maintain minimum wall thickness.
```

**Regardless of Feature Size (RFS) - Default:**

**Definition:** Tolerance applies regardless of actual feature size (no bonus).

**When to Use RFS:**
- Functional requirement demands tight position regardless of size
- Datum features (to establish stable DRF)
- Close-tolerance assemblies with no clearance

### Rule #1: Envelope Principle (ASME Y14.5)

**Statement:** For features of size (cylinders, widths, spheres), the surface shall not violate a perfect form boundary at Maximum Material Condition.

**Translation:** A shaft cannot be out-of-round, bent, or tapered beyond the point where it exceeds its maximum diameter.

**Example: Shaft Ø 1.000 ±0.005**

```
Allowable size: Ø 0.995 to Ø 1.005

Rule #1 Envelope: Perfect cylinder at Ø 1.005 (MMC)

Scenario 1: Shaft diameter measures Ø 0.995 everywhere
- Form error allowable: 0.010 (can be Ø 1.005 at any cross-section due to out-of-roundness)

Scenario 2: Shaft diameter measures Ø 1.003 everywhere
- Form error allowable: 0.002 (can be Ø 1.005 max at any cross-section)

Scenario 3: Shaft bent to Ø 1.006 effective diameter (bowed)
- REJECT: Violates Rule #1 envelope (exceeds Ø 1.005)
```

**Override Rule #1:**

Add ⊕ symbol (independently): Ø 1.000 ±0.005 ⊕

Now form can vary independent of size (requires separate form control like straightness or circularity).

## Form Tolerances (No Datum Required)

### Straightness (⏤)

**Controls:** How straight a line element or axis must be.

**Application 1: Surface Elements (Line Elements)**

```
Drawing Callout:
─────────────
    ⏤ 0.002

Meaning: Each longitudinal line element on the surface shall be contained within two parallel lines 0.002 apart.
```

**Inspection:** Surface plate and indicator, scan along length

**Application 2: Axis (Cylindrical Tolerance Zone)**

```
Drawing Callout:
Ø 0.500 ±0.005
  Ø ⏤ 0.005

Meaning: The axis shall be contained within a cylindrical zone of Ø 0.005.
```

**Inspection:** CMM - measure axis points along length, best-fit line, deviation

**Typical Values:**

| Feature Length | Precision | Standard | Loose |
|---------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **1-3"** | 0.0002 | 0.001 | 0.005 |
| **3-12"** | 0.0005 | 0.002 | 0.010 |
| **12-36"** | 0.001 | 0.005 | 0.020 |

### Flatness (○)

**Controls:** How flat a surface must be (3D form control).

```
Drawing Callout:
─────────────
    ○ 0.002

Meaning: The entire surface shall be contained between two parallel planes 0.002 apart.
```

**Inspection:**
- **Surface Plate:** Indicator sweep, measure high/low points (difference = flatness error)
- **CMM:** Collect points across surface, best-fit plane, max deviation
- **Optical:** Interferometry for ultra-flat surfaces (<0.00002")

**Typical Flatness Values:**

| Surface Size | Precision | Standard | Loose |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **1" × 1"** | 0.0001 | 0.0005 | 0.002 |
| **6" × 12"** | 0.0005 | 0.002 | 0.010 |
| **24" × 48"** | 0.002 | 0.010 | 0.040 |

**Gage Blocks (Reference Standard):**
- **AA Grade:** 0.000002" flatness
- **A+ Grade:** 0.000004"
- **AS-1 Grade:** 0.000008"

### Circularity (Roundness) (○)

**Controls:** How circular a cross-section must be (2D form control).

```
Drawing Callout:
    ○ 0.001

Meaning: At any cross-section perpendicular to axis, the circular outline shall be contained within two concentric circles 0.001 radially apart.
```

**Inspection:**
- **Spindle/Indicator:** Rotate part in V-block or chuck, indicator shows TIR (Total Indicator Reading)
- **Roundness Tester:** Precision spindle, stylus traces circumference, chart records out-of-roundness
- **CMM:** Measure points around circumference, best-fit circle, max deviation

**Circularity vs. Size:**

Circularity is INDEPENDENT of size:

```
Hole: Ø 1.000 ±0.005
Circularity: ○ 0.001

Scenario: Hole measures Ø 0.997 to Ø 1.003 around circumference
- Size: ACCEPT (within 0.995-1.005 range)
- Circularity: REJECT (0.006 range exceeds 0.001)
```

**Typical Circularity Values:**

| Application | Circularity Tolerance |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Bearing Bores (Precision)** | 0.0001-0.0003 |
| **Seal Surfaces** | 0.0002-0.0005 |
| **General Machined Shafts** | 0.0005-0.002 |
| **Cast or Molded Features** | 0.005-0.020 |

### Cylindricity (⌭)

**Controls:** How cylindrical an entire surface must be (combines roundness, straightness, taper).

```
Drawing Callout:
    ⌭ 0.002

Meaning: The entire cylindrical surface shall be contained between two coaxial cylinders 0.002 radially apart.
```

**Inspection:**
- **CMM:** Collect points across entire surface, best-fit cylinder, max deviation
- **Cylindricity Tester:** Stylus traces surface in 3D (helical scan)

**Cylindricity is VERY RESTRICTIVE:**

Contains:
- Circularity at all cross-sections
- Straightness of all line elements
- Taper (diameter variation along length)
- Coaxial alignment of all circular sections

**Use Sparingly:** Only for critical applications (precision spindles, hydraulic cylinders, gages)

**Typical Values:** 0.0002-0.001" for precision applications

## Profile Tolerances (Equal Bilateral, Unequal, Unilateral)

### Profile of a Surface (⌓)

**Most Versatile GD&T Control:** Can control form, orientation, and location of complex 3D surfaces.

**Basic Callout (Equal Bilateral):**

```
Drawing Callout:
   ⌓ 0.020 A

Meaning: The surface shall be contained within a tolerance zone of 0.020 wide (±0.010 from true profile), perpendicular to true profile, oriented to datum A.
```

**Unequal/Unilateral Profile:**

```
Symbol notation:
   ⌓ 0.030 ↓ 0.010 A

Meaning: Tolerance zone 0.030 total, with 0.010 outside true profile, 0.020 inside true profile.
```

**Applications:**

| Feature Type | Profile Use | Tolerance Typical |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Turbine Blade Airfoil** | Form and orientation of complex curve | 0.005-0.020 |
| **Molded Plastic Housing** | Control warpage, form | 0.010-0.050 |
| **Sheet Metal Bend** | Radius and angle control | 0.010-0.030 |
| **Machined Contour** | 3D surface accuracy | 0.002-0.010 |

**Inspection:**
- **CMM:** Scan surface points, compare to CAD nominal, deviation report
- **Optical Scanner:** Capture millions of points, color map shows deviation
- **Hard Gage:** For production (GO/NO-GO profile gage)

**Profile Without Datum (Form Only):**

```
   ⌓ 0.010

Meaning: Surface form shall be within 0.010 of true profile, but can be located/oriented anywhere (only controls shape).
```

### Profile of a Line (⌓)

**Controls:** 2D cross-section tolerance (at any cross-section).

**Less Common than Profile of Surface:** Use when tolerance applies to individual sections but may vary between sections.

**Example: Extruded Shape**

```
   ⌓ 0.005 A

Each cross-section perpendicular to A shall be within 0.005 of true profile, but sections can shift relative to each other.
```

## Orientation Tolerances (Require Datum)

### Perpendicularity (⊥)

**Controls:** How perpendicular (90°) a feature must be to a datum.

**Application 1: Surface Perpendicularity**

```
Drawing Callout:
    ⊥ 0.003 A

Meaning: The surface shall be contained between two parallel planes 0.003 apart, perpendicular to datum A.
```

**Application 2: Axis Perpendicularity (Cylindrical Zone)**

```
Drawing Callout:
Ø 0.250 ±0.003
  Ø ⊥ 0.005 A

Meaning: The axis shall be contained within a cylindrical zone Ø 0.005, perpendicular to datum A.
```

**Inspection:**
- **Granite Square on Surface Plate:** Indicator sweep along feature, perpendicular to datum
- **CMM:** Measure feature, construct axis/plane, angle to datum, convert to perpendicularity error

**Typical Perpendicularity Values:**

| Application | Perpendicularity | Angular Equivalent |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Precision Fixtures** | 0.0002 per inch | 0.002° (41 arc-seconds) |
| **General Machined Surfaces** | 0.001-0.003 per inch | 0.01-0.03° |
| **Sheet Metal** | 0.010-0.030 per inch | 0.1-0.3° |

### Parallelism (∕∕)

**Controls:** How parallel a feature must be to a datum.

**Application: Parallel Mounting Surfaces**

```
Drawing Callout:
    ∕∕ 0.002 A

Meaning: The surface shall be contained between two parallel planes 0.002 apart, parallel to datum A.
```

**Inspection:**
- **Surface Plate:** Part on datum A, indicator measures variation across surface (TIR = parallelism error)
- **CMM:** Measure both surfaces, calculate angle between, convert to parallelism deviation

**Parallelism vs. Flatness:**

- **Flatness 0.002:** Surface can be within 0.002 but at ANY angle
- **Parallelism 0.002 to A:** Surface must be within 0.002 AND parallel to datum A (more restrictive)

**Parallelism REFINES flatness (implied flatness ≤ parallelism tolerance)**

### Angularity (∠)

**Controls:** How accurate a specific angle must be relative to a datum.

```
Drawing Callout:
30° BASIC
    ∠ 0.005 A

Meaning: The surface shall be contained between two parallel planes 0.005 apart, at 30° basic angle to datum A.
```

**Basic Angle:** Theoretically exact (no tolerance), controlled by angularity tolerance zone

**Inspection:**
- **Sine Plate/Angle Block:** Set up at basic angle, indicator measures deviation
- **CMM:** Measure surface, calculate angle to datum, deviation = angularity error

**Angularity vs. Profile:**

For angled features, profile of surface often preferred (controls form + orientation simultaneously).

## Location Tolerances (Require Datum)

### Position (⌖) - Most Important GD&T Control

**Controls:** The location of features (holes, bosses, slots, tabs) relative to datums and each other.

**Cylindrical Tolerance Zone (Holes, Pins):**

```
Drawing Callout:
4× Ø 0.250 +0.005/-0.000
    ⌖ Ø 0.010 Ⓜ A|B|C
    (X, Y coordinates defined by basic dimensions)

Meaning: Each hole axis shall be located within a cylindrical zone Ø 0.010 at MMC, positioned at true position defined by basic dimensions, relative to datum reference frame A|B|C.
```

**Position vs. Coordinate Tolerances:**

**Coordinate Tolerance:** X 2.000 ±0.005, Y 3.000 ±0.005

- Creates SQUARE tolerance zone: 0.010 × 0.010
- Diagonal tolerance = 0.0141 (√(0.01² + 0.01²))
- Effective tolerance varies by direction (small at 0°/90°, large at 45°)

**Position Tolerance:** ⌖ Ø 0.010

- Creates CIRCULAR tolerance zone: Ø 0.010
- Tolerance constant in all directions
- Area = 57% LARGER than coordinate tolerance (π × 0.005² vs. 0.010²)

**Why Position is Better:**

| Aspect | Coordinate Tolerance | Position Tolerance |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Tolerance Zone** | Square (0.010 × 0.010) | Circular (Ø 0.010) |
| **Effective Area** | 0.0001 in² | 0.000157 in² (57% larger) |
| **Direction Variation** | ±0.0071 to ±0.005 | ±0.005 in all directions |
| **Manufacturing Cost** | Higher (smaller effective tolerance) | Lower (larger tolerance zone) |
| **Functionality** | Over-constrains diagonals | Correct functional tolerance |
| **Inspection** | X-Y separately | Radial from true position |

**Position with MMC - Bonus Tolerance:**

```
Hole: Ø 0.250 +0.005/-0.000 (0.250-0.255 allowable)
Position: ⌖ Ø 0.010 Ⓜ A|B|C

┌─────────┬──────────────┬────────────────────┐
│ Actual  │ Departure    │ Total Position     │
│ Hole Ø │ from MMC     │ Tolerance          │
├─────────┼──────────────┼────────────────────┤
│ 0.250   │ 0.000        │ Ø 0.010 (as drawn) │
│ 0.253   │ 0.003        │ Ø 0.013            │
│ 0.255   │ 0.005        │ Ø 0.015 (50% more!)│
└─────────┴──────────────┴────────────────────┘
```

**Position of Features at Different Locations:**

**Pattern of Features (Composite Position Control):**

```
Drawing Callout:
8× Ø 0.125 +0.003/-0.000
   ⌖ Ø 0.020 Ⓜ A|B|C    ← PLTZF (Pattern Locating Tolerance Zone Framework)
   ⌖ Ø 0.005 Ⓜ A        ← FRTZF (Feature Relating Tolerance Zone Framework)

Meaning:
- Upper tier: Each hole located within Ø 0.020 from true position relative to A|B|C (pattern location to part)
- Lower tier: Each hole located within Ø 0.005 relative to pattern center (holes to each other)

Why Use Composite:
- Functional: Bolt pattern can shift 0.020 on part, but holes must be 0.005 to each other (fits mating bolt circle)
- Larger tolerance for pattern location, tight tolerance for hole-to-hole spacing
```

**Projected Tolerance Zone:**

```
Application: Threaded hole for bolt, bolt extends above surface

Callout:
M8×1.25 - 6H, 20 deep
⌖ Ø 0.5 Ⓜ Ⓟ 25 A|B|C

Ⓟ 25 = Projected tolerance zone extends 25mm above surface

Why: Controls bolt orientation where it matters (at nut location), not inside hole.
```

### Concentricity (⌯)

**Controls:** How closely the median points of a feature align with a datum axis (VERY DIFFICULT TO MEASURE).

```
Drawing Callout:
    ⌯ 0.002 A

Meaning: The median points of all diametrically opposed elements of the feature shall lie within a cylindrical tolerance zone Ø 0.002 coaxial with datum axis A.
```

**Inspection Challenge:**

Must measure median points (center of diametrically opposed measurements), not surface points.

**Typical Inspection:**
1. Mount part on datum axis A (precision spindle or between centers)
2. Measure diameter at multiple cross-sections
3. Calculate median point of each cross-section (center of opposed measurements)
4. Evaluate if median points fall within Ø 0.002 zone

**Concentricity vs. Runout:**

| Characteristic | Concentricity | Runout (Circular or Total) |
|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Measures** | Median points (axis) | Surface points |
| **Inspection** | Complex (calculate medians) | Simple (rotate, indicator reads TIR) |
| **Use** | Balanced rotating assemblies (minimize vibration) | General runout control |
| **Recommendation** | AVOID (use runout instead unless specifically required) | PREFERRED |

**When to Use Concentricity:**

- Precision spindles requiring minimal vibration (balance-critical)
- Medical devices with specific regulatory requirements

**Better Alternative:** Use Position or Runout for most applications (easier to measure, functionally equivalent)

### Symmetry (↕)

**Controls:** How closely the median points of a feature align with a datum plane (VERY DIFFICULT TO MEASURE).

```
Drawing Callout:
    ↕ 0.005 A

Meaning: The median points of all opposed elements of the feature shall lie within a tolerance zone 0.005 wide, symmetrical about datum plane A.
```

**Similar Issues as Concentricity:**

- Difficult to measure median points
- Rarely used in modern practice
- **Better Alternative:** Use Position for slots, tabs (easier to measure, functionally equivalent)

## Runout Tolerances (Require Datum Axis)

### Circular Runout (↗)

**Controls:** Variation of a surface at individual circular cross-sections during one full rotation about a datum axis.

```
Drawing Callout:
    ↗ 0.003 A

Meaning: With part rotated 360° about datum axis A, indicator reading at any single position shall not vary more than 0.003 (TIR).
```

**Inspection (Simple!):**

1. Mount part on datum axis A (between centers, collet, chuck aligned to datum)
2. Place indicator on surface at specific location
3. Rotate part 360°
4. Read TIR (Total Indicator Reading)
5. Repeat at multiple locations along surface

**What Circular Runout Controls:**

- Circularity at each cross-section
- Coaxiality of that cross-section to datum axis
- Does NOT control taper or profile variation along length (see Total Runout)

**Typical Values:**

| Application | Circular Runout |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Precision Bearing Journals** | 0.0001-0.0003 |
| **Seal Surfaces** | 0.0003-0.001 |
| **General Shafts** | 0.001-0.005 |
| **Non-Critical Diameters** | 0.005-0.020 |

### Total Runout (⤢)

**Controls:** Variation of entire surface during full rotation about datum axis (includes circular runout + taper + profile).

```
Drawing Callout:
    ⤢ 0.005 A

Meaning: With part rotated 360° about datum axis A, indicator traversed along entire surface shall not vary more than 0.005 total.
```

**Inspection:**

1. Mount part on datum axis A
2. Place indicator on surface
3. Rotate part continuously while slowly traversing indicator along length
4. Read TOTAL TIR across entire surface

**What Total Runout Controls:**

- Circular runout at all cross-sections (circularity, coaxiality)
- Straightness of surface along length
- Taper (diameter variation)
- Profile (combines all surface errors into single tolerance)

**Total Runout is Very Comprehensive:**

Effectively controls cylindricity + coaxiality to datum in single, easy-to-inspect callout.

**Typical Values:**

| Application | Total Runout |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Precision Spindles** | 0.0002-0.0005 |
| **Turbine Shafts** | 0.0005-0.002 |
| **General Machined Shafts** | 0.002-0.010 |

**Circular vs. Total Runout:**

```
Scenario: Tapered shaft (0.998" at one end, 1.002" at other)

Circular Runout 0.002 A:
- ACCEPT: Each cross-section could be round within 0.002 TIR
- Does not detect taper (measured one location at a time)

Total Runout 0.002 A:
- REJECT: Diameter varies 0.004 along length (exceeds 0.002)
- Detects taper (measured across entire surface)
```

## Tolerance Stack-Up Analysis

### Worst-Case Stack-Up

**Method:** Add maximum tolerances to find worst-case assembly variation.

**Example: Bolt Hole Alignment**

```
Assembly:
Part A: Hole position ⌖ Ø 0.020 Ⓜ (hole Ø 0.250 +0.005/-0.000)
Part B: Hole position ⌖ Ø 0.020 Ⓜ (hole Ø 0.250 +0.005/-0.000)
Bolt: Ø 0.240 (clearance fit)

Worst-Case Stack:
Part A hole at MMC (Ø 0.250), shifted 0.010 from true position
Part B hole at MMC (Ø 0.250), shifted 0.010 from true position (opposite direction)
Total misalignment: 0.020 (0.010 + 0.010)

Minimum clearance:
Hole MMC: 0.250
Bolt: 0.240
Diametral clearance: 0.010
Position error: 0.020

Result: REJECT worst-case (hole edges misaligned by 0.020, but clearance only 0.010)

Solution:
- Increase hole size to Ø 0.260 (clearance 0.020 = position tolerance)
- OR reduce position tolerance to Ø 0.010 each (total misalignment 0.010 = clearance)
```

**Worst-Case Formula:**

```
Assembly Gap = (Hole Dia Min - Bolt Dia Max) - (Pos Tol Part A + Pos Tol Part B)

For successful assembly, Assembly Gap ≥ 0
```

### Statistical Stack-Up (RSS - Root Sum Square)

**Method:** Assume tolerances vary randomly (normal distribution), combine statistically.

**RSS Formula:**

```
Total Variation = √(Tol₁² + Tol₂² + Tol₃² + ...)
```

**Example (Same bolt hole assembly):**

```
Part A position: ⌖ Ø 0.020
Part B position: ⌖ Ø 0.020

Statistical misalignment (RSS):
Total = √(0.010² + 0.010²) = √0.0002 = 0.0141

Comparison:
- Worst-Case: 0.020 (100% chance of occurrence extremely rare)
- RSS (3σ): 0.0141 (99.7% of assemblies better than this)

Assembly Gap (RSS):
(0.250 - 0.240) - 0.0141 = -0.0041

Result: ACCEPT statistically (99.7% confidence assemblies will fit)
```

**When to Use RSS vs. Worst-Case:**

| Application | Method | Reasoning |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| **Aerospace Critical, Safety** | Worst-Case | 100% interchangeability required, no assembly rejection acceptable |
| **High-Volume Production** | RSS | Statistical confidence adequate, allows larger tolerances, lower cost |
| **Medical Devices** | Worst-Case or RSS | Depends on risk analysis, regulatory requirements |
| **Consumer Products** | RSS | Cost-sensitive, small percentage assembly issues acceptable |

## CMM Inspection per GD&T

### CMM Programming for GD&T

**Process:**

1. **Import CAD Model:** Load part geometry into CMM software
2. **Define Datums:** Measure datum features, establish DRF (align CMM coordinate system)
3. **Measure Features:** Collect points on features per GD&T callouts
4. **Evaluate GD&T:** Software calculates geometric errors per ASME Y14.5
5. **Generate Report:** Pass/fail for each GD&T callout, deviation values

**Datum Establishment on CMM:**

```
Example: DRF A|B|C (3-2-1 scheme)

Step 1: Measure Datum A (planar surface)
- Collect 9+ points on surface
- Best-fit plane
- Set as Z=0, constrains Z-translation and X/Y rotation (3 DOF)

Step 2: Measure Datum B (cylindrical hole)
- Collect 12+ points around hole
- Best-fit circle/cylinder
- Set as Y=0, constrains Y-translation and Z-rotation (2 DOF)

Step 3: Measure Datum C (slot or feature)
- Collect points to define final constraint
- Set as X=0, constrains X-translation (1 DOF)

Result: CMM coordinate system now aligned to part DRF (all 6 DOF constrained)
```

**Measuring Position Tolerance:**

```
Callout: 4× Ø 0.250 ±0.003, ⌖ Ø 0.010 Ⓜ A|B|C

CMM Process:
1. Establish DRF A|B|C
2. For each hole:
   - Collect 12-20 points around circumference
   - Best-fit circle, determine center (X, Y)
   - Measure diameter (for MMC bonus calculation)
3. Calculate deviation from true position (basic dimensions):
   Position Error = √((X_actual - X_basic)² + (Y_actual - Y_basic)²) × 2
4. Calculate allowable tolerance (with MMC bonus):
   Allowable = 0.010 + (Actual Dia - MMC Dia)
5. Compare: Position Error ≤ Allowable → ACCEPT

Example:
Hole 1: Center at X=2.003, Y=3.002 (basic X=2.000, Y=3.000)
Deviation = √(0.003² + 0.002²) × 2 = 0.0072
Actual diameter = 0.252
Allowable = 0.010 + (0.252 - 0.250) = 0.012
Result: 0.0072 < 0.012 → ACCEPT
```

**Measuring Perpendicularity:**

```
Callout: Ø ⊥ 0.005 A

CMM Process:
1. Measure Datum A, establish plane
2. Measure feature (cylindrical hole/boss):
   - Collect points along length at multiple cross-sections
   - Best-fit cylinder, extract axis
3. Calculate angle between axis and perpendicular to Datum A
4. Convert angle to perpendicularity error at feature length:
   Perp Error = tan(angle) × feature_length × 2 (diametral)
5. Compare to tolerance

Result: If Perp Error ≤ 0.005 → ACCEPT
```

### CMM Measurement Uncertainty

**Key Concept:** CMM measurements have uncertainty (±0.00005" to ±0.0002" typical).

**Guard Banding:**

To ensure parts are truly in tolerance, apply guard band (safety margin):

```
Example:
GD&T Tolerance: ⌖ Ø 0.010
CMM Uncertainty: ±0.0001 (U95, 95% confidence)
Guard Band: 3× uncertainty = 0.0003

Adjusted Acceptance Limit:
Upper Limit: 0.010 - 0.0003 = 0.0097

Part measures 0.0096 on CMM: ACCEPT (within guard band)
Part measures 0.0099 on CMM: REJECT (exceeds guard band, might be 0.0100+ actual)
```

**CMM Capability for GD&T:**

| CMM Type | Volumetric Accuracy | Best For GD&T Applications |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Shop Floor CMM** | ±0.0002-0.0005" | General inspection, ±0.002" tolerances |
| **Inspection Room CMM** | ±0.00005-0.0001" | Precision inspection, ±0.0005" tolerances |
| **Ultra-Precision CMM** | ±0.00001-0.00003" | Gage calibration, ±0.0001" tolerances |

## Common GD&T Mistakes and Best Practices

### Mistake 1: Missing or Improper Datum Reference Frame

**Wrong:**

```
⌖ Ø 0.010 (no datum callout)
```

**Why Wrong:** Position without datum is meaningless (position relative to what?)

**Correct:**

```
⌖ Ø 0.010 Ⓜ A|B|C
```

**Exception:** Position can be without datum for features located to each other only (pattern of holes where pattern can float on part).

### Mistake 2: Over-Tolerancing with Multiple Controls

**Wrong (Redundant):**

```
Ø 1.000 ±0.002
⊥ 0.001 A (perpendicularity of axis)
⌖ Ø 0.003 Ⓜ A (position controls perpendicularity already)
```

**Why Wrong:** Position tolerance zone of Ø 0.003 perpendicular to A ALREADY controls perpendicularity to 0.003. Additional ⊥ 0.001 is redundant (and tighter, creating conflict).

**Correct (Choose One):**

Option 1: ⌖ Ø 0.001 Ⓜ A (position controls location AND perpendicularity)
Option 2: ⊥ 0.001 A (just perpendicularity, no location control)

### Mistake 3: Using Concentricity/Symmetry When Runout/Position Work

**Wrong (Difficult to Measure):**

```
⌯ 0.002 A (concentricity)
```

**Better (Same Function, Easier Inspection):**

```
⤢ 0.002 A (total runout - same functional control, simple inspection)
```

**OR:**

```
⌖ Ø 0.002 A (position - can use CMM, same functional control)
```

### Mistake 4: Forgetting MMC/LMC When Applicable

**Opportunity Missed:**

```
4× Ø 0.250 ±0.005
⌖ Ø 0.010 A|B|C (RFS by default)
```

**Better (Allows Bonus Tolerance):**

```
4× Ø 0.250 +0.005/-0.000
⌖ Ø 0.010 Ⓜ A|B|C

Result: Holes at 0.255 get Ø 0.015 position tolerance (50% more), easier to manufacture, lower cost.
```

**When NOT to Use MMC:**

- Close-fit pins (no clearance for bonus)
- Optical alignment (position critical regardless of size)

### Mistake 5: Ambiguous Profile Tolerance Zones

**Wrong (Unclear):**

```
⌓ 0.020 (which way does tolerance extend from true profile?)
```

**Correct (Equal Bilateral - Default):**

```
⌓ 0.020 A (±0.010 from true profile)
```

**Correct (Unequal, Explicitly Defined):**

```
⌓ 0.030 ↓ 0.020 A (0.020 outside, 0.010 inside true profile)
```

### Best Practices

**1. Apply GD&T Where It Matters:**

Don't GD&T everything - apply to:
- Mating features (fits, assemblies)
- Functional surfaces (sealing, bearing, alignment)
- Critical dimensions (safety, performance)

Non-critical features: Use traditional ±tolerances

**2. Choose Simplest Control:**

| Requirement | Don't Use | Use Instead |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Coaxiality** | Concentricity | Position or Runout |
| **Hole Location** | X±, Y± | Position (57% larger tolerance) |
| **Complex Surface** | Multiple controls | Profile of Surface (single control) |
| **Shaft Runout** | Multiple circularity + straightness | Total Runout (one control) |

**3. Datum Selection:**

Choose datums that represent functional assembly:
- Primary: Largest, most stable surface
- Secondary: Feature that prevents rotation
- Tertiary: Feature that prevents final translation

**4. Tolerance Values:**

Start with function-based analysis:
- What clearance/interference is acceptable?
- What orientation error impacts function?
- Set GD&T tolerances based on functional limits

Then verify manufacturability and cost.

## Conclusion

Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T) is the essential language of precision manufacturing, providing unambiguous communication of design intent, functional requirements, and inspection criteria. GD&T enables larger tolerance zones (57%+ vs. coordinate tolerancing), functional control of what matters (form, orientation, location), and consistent interpretation between design, manufacturing, and quality organizations.

Mastering GD&T requires understanding the 14 geometric characteristics, datum reference frames, material condition modifiers, tolerance stack-up analysis, and CMM inspection methods. Proper application of GD&T reduces manufacturing costs 15-30%, ensures 100% interchangeability, and eliminates drawing ambiguity.
