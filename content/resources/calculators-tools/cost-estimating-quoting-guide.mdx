# Manufacturing Cost Estimating & Quoting Guide

## Executive Summary

Accurate cost estimating and competitive quoting are critical skills that determine profitability and market success. Quote too high and you lose business; quote too low and you lose money. This comprehensive guide provides proven frameworks, formulas, and best practices for estimating manufacturing costs and developing winning quotes.

**The Importance of Accurate Estimating:**

Cost estimating impacts every aspect of your business:
- **Profitability:** 80% of product cost is locked in during design and estimating phase
- **Competitiveness:** Accurate estimates enable competitive pricing while maintaining margins
- **Customer Relationships:** Accurate quotes build trust; surprises damage relationships
- **Capacity Planning:** Realistic time estimates enable effective scheduling and resource allocation
- **Continuous Improvement:** Comparing estimates to actuals drives process improvement

**Estimating Accuracy by Project Phase:**

| Project Phase | Typical Accuracy Range | Estimating Effort | Information Available |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Conceptual** | -25% to +75% | Minimal (1-2 hours) | Rough sketch, general requirements |
| **Preliminary Design** | -15% to +30% | Moderate (2-8 hours) | Preliminary drawings, material specs |
| **Detailed Design** | -10% to +15% | Significant (8-40 hours) | Complete drawings, specifications |
| **Production** | -5% to +10% | Comprehensive (40+ hours) | Proven processes, historical data |

**Key Estimating Principles:**

1. **Understand All Requirements:** Missing requirements kill profitability
2. **Break Down Complexity:** Estimate piece-by-piece, then sum total
3. **Use Historical Data:** Past performance predicts future costs
4. **Account for Learning:** First piece costs more than 100th piece
5. **Include Contingency:** Unknown unknowns will emerge
6. **Document Assumptions:** Make risks visible upfront

## Cost Estimating Fundamentals

### Total Manufacturing Cost Structure

**Manufacturing Cost Equation:**

**Total Manufacturing Cost = Direct Material + Direct Labor + Manufacturing Overhead + Tooling + Outside Services**

**Then add:**

**Selling Price = Total Manufacturing Cost + G&A Overhead + Profit Margin**

**Typical Cost Breakdown (Precision Machining):**

| Cost Element | Percentage of Total | Variables Affecting Cost | Estimating Complexity |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Direct Material** | 30-50% | Material type, buy-to-fly ratio, scrap rate | Low (known from drawing) |
| **Direct Labor** | 15-30% | Cycle time, setup time, labor rate | Medium (requires process planning) |
| **Manufacturing Overhead** | 20-35% | Machine depreciation, utilities, indirect labor | Low (burden rate applied) |
| **Tooling** | 5-15% | Tool life, material hardness, complexity | Medium (requires tool planning) |
| **Outside Services** | 0-20% | Heat treat, plating, coating, NDT | Low (subcontractor quotes) |
| **G&A Overhead** | 10-20% of mfg cost | Company size, efficiency | Low (overhead rate applied) |
| **Profit Margin** | 10-25% of cost | Market conditions, competition | Strategic decision |

### Direct Material Cost Estimation

**Material Cost Formula:**

**Material Cost = (Finished Part Weight + Scrap Weight) × Material Cost per Pound + Material Processing Adders**

**Example: Aluminum 7075-T6 Aerospace Part**

**Given:**
- Finished part weight: 2.5 lbs
- Raw stock: 4" × 6" × 8" block = 15.0 lbs
- Scrap weight: 15.0 - 2.5 = 12.5 lbs (83% waste!)
- Material cost: $3.50/lb
- Material processing: $0.50/lb (sawing, certification)

**Calculation:**
- Raw material: 15.0 lbs × $3.50/lb = $52.50
- Processing: 15.0 lbs × $0.50/lb = $7.50
- **Total Material Cost: $60.00**
- **Material Cost per Part: $60.00** (assuming scrap is not recovered)

**Material Cost Considerations:**

**1. Buy-to-Fly Ratio:**

The ratio of raw material weight to finished part weight:

| Industry/Application | Typical Buy-to-Fly Ratio | Material Waste | Cost Impact |
|---------------------|-------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Commercial Machining** | 2:1 to 5:1 | 50-80% | Moderate |
| **Aerospace Structural** | 10:1 to 20:1 | 90-95% | Severe |
| **Titanium Aerospace** | 12:1 to 25:1 | 92-96% | Extreme |
| **Near-Net-Shape Forging** | 1.2:1 to 2:1 | 17-50% | Low |

**Material Waste Reduction Strategies:**
- Specify near-net-shape forgings or castings
- Nest multiple parts in single billet when possible
- Recover and recycle scrap (40-60% value recovery for aerospace alloys)
- Consider additive manufacturing for complex, low-volume parts

**2. Material Market Pricing:**

Material costs fluctuate significantly:

**Current Market Prices (2024, Subject to Change):**

| Material | Price per Pound | Price Volatility | Lead Time | Notes |
|----------|----------------|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Aluminum 6061** | $2.00-3.00 | Low | 2-4 weeks | Commodity pricing, stable |
| **Aluminum 7075** | $3.00-4.50 | Low-Moderate | 4-8 weeks | Aerospace grade premium |
| **Stainless 304/316** | $2.50-4.00 | Moderate | 2-6 weeks | Nickel price dependent |
| **Titanium Ti-6Al-4V** | $15.00-30.00 | High | 8-16 weeks | Supply constrained |
| **Inconel 718** | $25.00-50.00 | High | 12-20 weeks | Limited sources |
| **Tool Steel (H13, D2)** | $3.00-6.00 | Low-Moderate | 4-12 weeks | Grade and size dependent |

**Pricing Strategies for Material Volatility:**
- **Short-Term Quotes (<90 days):** Lock in current pricing
- **Long-Term Quotes (>90 days):** Include material escalation clause
- **Large Orders:** Obtain supplier quotes for specific quantity and delivery
- **Commodity Materials:** Index to market (e.g., LME aluminum price)

**3. Material Processing Adders:**

Additional costs beyond raw material:

| Service | Cost Adder | When Required | Lead Time Impact |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Sawing/Cutting** | $0.25-0.75/lb | All raw stock | +1-3 days |
| **Material Certification** | $50-150 per heat | Aerospace, medical, critical | Included or +1-2 weeks |
| **Chemical/Mechanical Testing** | $200-800 per test | Customer requirement | +1-2 weeks |
| **Special Packaging** | $25-100 per shipment | Moisture-sensitive, fragile | +1-2 days |
| **Expedite Fee** | 10-30% premium | Rush delivery | Reduces lead time 50% |

### Direct Labor Cost Estimation

**Labor Cost Formula:**

**Labor Cost = [(Setup Time + (Run Time per Piece × Quantity)) / 60] × Burden Labor Rate**

**Burden Labor Rate Components:**

| Component | Typical Range | Included Costs |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Base Hourly Wage** | $18-35/hour | Machinist/operator wages |
| **Benefits & Taxes** | 30-45% of wage | FICA, unemployment, workers comp, insurance, vacation, 401k |
| **Indirect Labor** | 20-40% of direct | Supervision, material handling, programming, quality |
| **Total Burden Labor Rate** | $35-75/hour | Fully loaded rate |

**Example Labor Cost Calculation:**

**Part: Precision Machined Bracket**
- Quantity: 100 pieces
- Setup time: 2.0 hours (fixture setup, first article, tool changes)
- Run time per piece: 18 minutes (0.30 hours)
- Burden labor rate: $55/hour

**Calculation:**
- Setup: 2.0 hours × $55/hour = $110
- Run: 100 pieces × 0.30 hours × $55/hour = $1,650
- **Total Labor Cost: $1,760**
- **Labor per Piece (qty 100): $17.60**

**Quantity Impact on Labor Cost per Piece:**

| Quantity | Setup Cost | Run Cost | Total | Per Piece | Notes |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| **1** | $110 | $16.50 | $126.50 | $126.50 | Setup dominates |
| **10** | $110 | $165 | $275 | $27.50 | Setup still major |
| **50** | $110 | $825 | $935 | $18.70 | Setup becoming smaller |
| **100** | $110 | $1,650 | $1,760 | $17.60 | Run time dominates |
| **500** | $110 | $8,250 | $8,360 | $16.72 | Setup negligible |

**Setup Time Estimation:**

Setup time varies by process and part complexity:

| Operation Type | Typical Setup Time | Setup Activities |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **CNC Turning (Simple)** | 0.5-1.5 hours | Chuck setup, tool changes, offset setup, first article |
| **CNC Turning (Complex)** | 1.5-4.0 hours | Fixture setup, multiple tool changes, probe setup, inspection |
| **CNC Milling (2-3 Axis)** | 1.0-3.0 hours | Vise/fixture setup, tool loading, work offset setup, first article |
| **CNC Milling (4-5 Axis)** | 2.0-6.0 hours | Complex fixture, indexing setup, extensive tool library, probing |
| **Grinding (Precision)** | 1.5-4.0 hours | Wheel dressing, fixture setup, thermal stabilization, gage setup |
| **Wire EDM** | 2.0-6.0 hours | Program verification, wire threading, fixturing, first article |
| **Inspection (CMM)** | 1.0-3.0 hours | Part fixturing, program creation/verification, gage calibration |

**Run Time Estimation Methods:**

**1. CAM Software Simulation (Most Accurate):**
- Generate CNC program in CAM software
- Simulate toolpaths to get cycle time
- Accuracy: ±5-15% (accounts for rapids, spindle acceleration, etc.)
- Best for: Complex parts, 5-axis work, high-accuracy quotes

**2. Handbook Time Standards:**
- Use machining handbooks (Machinery's Handbook, etc.)
- Calculate based on material removal rate formulas
- Accuracy: ±20-40%
- Best for: Standard operations, quick estimates

**3. Historical Data (Most Practical):**
- Reference similar parts machined previously
- Adjust for size, material, complexity differences
- Accuracy: ±10-25% if similar part available
- Best for: Repeat business, part families

**4. Estimating Software:**
- Specialized software (Costimator, MTI, aPriori)
- Feature-based cost estimation
- Accuracy: ±15-30%
- Best for: Large-volume quoting, consistency

**Material Removal Rate Example:**

**Turning Operation: Reduce 2.000" diameter to 1.500" diameter, 6" length**

**Given:**
- Material: Stainless Steel 304
- Recommended cutting speed: 200 SFM
- Feed rate: 0.012 IPR (inches per revolution)
- Depth of cut: 0.125" (radius) = 0.250" diameter reduction per pass
- Number of passes: 2 passes (0.500" total diameter reduction)

**Calculation:**
- **RPM = (Cutting Speed × 12) / (π × Diameter)**
- RPM = (200 × 12) / (π × 2.0) = 382 RPM
- **Feed Rate (IPM) = RPM × Feed per Rev**
- Feed Rate = 382 × 0.012 = 4.6 IPM
- **Time per Pass = Length / Feed Rate**
- Time = 6.0" / 4.6 IPM = 1.3 minutes per pass
- **Total Time = 1.3 min × 2 passes = 2.6 minutes**
- **Add tool changes, measurements:** +0.5 minutes
- **Total Cycle Time: ~3.1 minutes per piece**

### Manufacturing Overhead

**Overhead Rate Methods:**

**1. Machine Hour Rate (Most Common):**

Each machine has a specific hourly rate based on its cost, depreciation, and floor space:

| Machine Type | Hourly Rate | Rate Components | When to Use |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Manual Mill/Lathe** | $40-60/hour | Depreciation, utilities, maintenance, tooling | Manual operations |
| **CNC Turning (Standard)** | $75-100/hour | Equipment cost, controls, tooling, programming | CNC turning work |
| **CNC Milling (3-Axis)** | $85-120/hour | Equipment, larger footprint, tooling library | CNC milling work |
| **CNC Milling (5-Axis)** | $125-200/hour | High equipment cost, specialized tooling | Complex 5-axis work |
| **Grinding (Precision)** | $100-150/hour | Equipment, wheels, environmental controls | Precision grinding |
| **Wire EDM** | $110-175/hour | Equipment, wire consumption, electrode cost | Wire EDM operations |
| **CMM Inspection** | $80-140/hour | CMM investment, climate control, software | Inspection operations |

**Machine Hour Rate Calculation Example:**

**For CNC Vertical Machining Center:**
- **Equipment Cost:** $180,000
- **Depreciation:** 7 years = $25,714/year
- **Floor Space:** 200 sq ft × $15/sq ft/year = $3,000/year
- **Utilities:** $2,400/year (electric, coolant disposal)
- **Maintenance:** $5,000/year (preventive maintenance, repairs)
- **Insurance:** $1,500/year
- **Total Annual Cost:** $37,614/year
- **Available Hours:** 2,080 hours/year (1 shift) × 75% utilization = 1,560 hours
- **Machine Hour Rate = $37,614 / 1,560 hours = $24.11/hour** (equipment only)
- **Add labor burden:** $55/hour
- **Total Machine + Labor Rate: $79/hour**

**2. Departmental Overhead Rate:**

Single rate for entire department:
- Simpler to administer
- Less accurate for diverse equipment
- Typical range: $75-150/hour for machining department

**3. Activity-Based Costing (ABC):**

Allocate overhead based on activities (setup, inspection, material handling):
- Most accurate for complex operations
- More complex to administer
- Used by large manufacturers and aerospace

### Tooling Cost Estimation

**Tooling Costs Include:**

1. **Consumable Cutting Tools:** End mills, drills, inserts, saw blades
2. **Durable Tooling:** Holders, collets, arbors, boring heads
3. **Special Tooling:** Custom fixtures, dedicated gauges, form tools
4. **Tool Maintenance:** Sharpening, reconditioning, replacement

**Tooling Cost Methods:**

**Method 1: Percentage of Labor (Simple):**

Apply tooling as percentage of labor cost:
- **Easy Materials (Aluminum):** 8-12% of labor
- **Medium Materials (Steel, Stainless):** 15-25% of labor
- **Difficult Materials (Titanium, Inconel):** 40-80% of labor
- **Very Difficult (Hardened Tool Steel, Carbide):** 80-150% of labor

**Example:**
- Labor cost: $1,760 (from earlier example)
- Material: Stainless Steel (medium difficulty)
- **Tooling = $1,760 × 20% = $352**

**Method 2: Tool Life Calculation (Accurate):**

Calculate tool cost based on parts per tool:

**Example: End Mill in Stainless Steel**
- End mill cost: $45 each
- Tool life: 120 parts before replacement
- **Tooling cost per part = $45 / 120 = $0.38 per part**

**If multiple tools required:**
- 3/8" end mill: $45 / 120 parts = $0.38
- 1/4" drill: $12 / 200 parts = $0.06
- 1/2" face mill (insert): $8 / 50 parts = $0.16
- **Total tooling per part: $0.60**

**Tool Life by Material (Carbide Tools):**

| Material | Relative Tool Life | Tool Life Index | Cost Multiplier |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Aluminum** | Excellent | 1.0x (baseline) | 1.0x |
| **Mild Steel** | Very Good | 0.8x | 1.25x |
| **Stainless Steel** | Fair | 0.4x | 2.5x |
| **Tool Steel (Soft)** | Fair | 0.5x | 2.0x |
| **Titanium** | Poor | 0.2x | 5.0x |
| **Inconel/Superalloys** | Very Poor | 0.1x | 10.0x |
| **Hardened Steel (Rc 50+)** | Very Poor | 0.08x | 12.5x |

**Special Tooling Amortization:**

Custom tooling cost amortized over expected production:

**Example: Custom Fixture**
- Fixture design and fabrication: $2,500
- Expected production quantity: 500 parts over 2 years
- **Amortized tooling cost = $2,500 / 500 = $5.00 per part**

**Considerations:**
- Charge customer upfront for special tooling (non-recurring engineering - NRE)
- Amortize over guaranteed order quantity only
- Retain tooling for potential future orders

### Outside Processing Costs

**Common Outside Services:**

| Service | Typical Cost | Lead Time | Cost Driver |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Heat Treatment (Steel)** | $3-10 per lb | 5-10 days | Process type, material, size |
| **Heat Treatment (Aluminum)** | $2-6 per lb | 3-7 days | T6 treatment standard |
| **Anodizing (Type II, Clear)** | $0.75-2.00 per sq ft | 5-10 days | Surface area, color, masking |
| **Anodizing (Type III, Hardcoat)** | $1.50-4.00 per sq ft | 7-14 days | Thickness, masking complexity |
| **Plating (Electroless Nickel)** | $2-5 per sq ft | 7-14 days | Thickness, masking |
| **Plating (Chromium)** | $3-8 per sq ft | 10-21 days | Regulatory compliance, masking |
| **Powder Coating** | $1-3 per sq ft | 3-7 days | Color, thickness, quantity |
| **Passivation (Stainless)** | $1.50-4.00 per lb | 3-7 days | Citric vs nitric acid |
| **NDT - Fluorescent Penetrant** | $25-75 per part | 2-5 days | Size, complexity, standard |
| **NDT - X-Ray** | $100-400 per part | 5-10 days | Size, number of angles, film vs digital |

**Obtaining Outside Processing Quotes:**

**For Estimating:**
- Maintain database of typical costs from preferred suppliers
- Get actual quotes for orders >$500 or critical processes
- Add 10-20% contingency for estimating if no firm quote

**For Production:**
- Obtain firm quotes before committing to customer
- Include lead time in overall schedule
- Verify quality certifications (NADCAP for aerospace, ISO 17025 for testing)

## Pricing Strategy and Margin

### Gross Margin vs. Profit Margin

**Definitions:**

**Gross Margin:**
Gross Margin % = [(Selling Price - Total Manufacturing Cost) / Selling Price] × 100%

**Profit Margin (Net Margin):**
Profit Margin % = [(Selling Price - Total Cost including G&A) / Selling Price] × 100%

**Example:**

| Cost Element | Amount | Calculation |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| **Direct Material** | $60.00 | From earlier example |
| **Direct Labor** | $17.60 | 100-piece quantity |
| **Manufacturing Overhead** | $26.40 | Machine rate × time |
| **Tooling** | $3.52 | 20% of labor |
| **Outside Services** | $5.00 | Anodizing |
| **Total Manufacturing Cost** | **$112.52** | Sum of above |
| **G&A Overhead (15%)** | $16.88 | 15% of manufacturing cost |
| **Total Cost** | **$129.40** | Manufacturing + G&A |
| **Target Profit Margin (20%)** | $32.35 | 20% of total cost |
| **Selling Price** | **$161.75** | Total cost + profit |

**Verification:**
- Gross Margin = ($161.75 - $112.52) / $161.75 = 30.4%
- Profit Margin = ($161.75 - $129.40) / $161.75 = 20.0% ✓

### Target Margin Guidelines

**Margin by Order Type:**

| Order Type | Target Gross Margin | Target Profit Margin | Rationale |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **Prototype/NRE** | 40-60% | 25-35% | High risk, low volume, engineering-intensive |
| **Production (New Customer)** | 30-40% | 15-25% | Competitive pricing to win business |
| **Production (Existing Customer)** | 25-35% | 12-20% | Relationship pricing, proven reliability |
| **High Volume (>1000/year)** | 20-30% | 10-15% | Volume efficiencies, competitive market |
| **Commodity Parts** | 15-25% | 8-12% | Price-driven market, low complexity |

**Margin Adjustments:**

**Increase Margin (+5-15%) When:**
- New customer with unproven payment history
- Rush delivery required (<50% normal lead time)
- Difficult material or process (Inconel, hardened steel)
- Tight tolerances (±0.0005" or tighter)
- High scrap risk or difficult inspection
- Low competition (sole-source or specialized capability)

**Decrease Margin (-5-10%) When:**
- Large volume with long-term commitment
- Preferred customer with excellent payment history
- Fill-in work during low capacity utilization
- Standard processes and materials
- Opportunity for follow-on business

### Learning Curve Effects

**Learning Curve Principle:**

As cumulative quantity increases, labor hours per unit decrease predictably:

**Learning Curve Formula:**

**T(n) = T(1) × n^b**

Where:
- T(n) = time for nth unit
- T(1) = time for first unit
- n = cumulative quantity
- b = log(learning rate) / log(2)

**Common Learning Rates:**

| Industry/Process | Learning Rate | Meaning | b Factor |
|------------------|---------------|---------|----------|
| **Aerospace Assembly** | 80% | 20% improvement when quantity doubles | -0.322 |
| **Machining (Complex)** | 85% | 15% improvement when quantity doubles | -0.234 |
| **Machining (Standard)** | 90% | 10% improvement when quantity doubles | -0.152 |
| **Simple Assembly** | 95% | 5% improvement when quantity doubles | -0.074 |

**Learning Curve Example:**

**First piece:** 2.0 hours labor
**Learning rate:** 85% (typical for complex machining)

| Cumulative Qty | Time per Unit | Calculation | Cumulative Hours |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| **1** | 2.00 hours | First piece | 2.00 |
| **2** | 1.70 hours | 2.00 × 0.85 | 3.70 |
| **4** | 1.45 hours | 1.70 × 0.85 | 7.49 |
| **8** | 1.23 hours | 1.45 × 0.85 | 17.33 |
| **16** | 1.05 hours | 1.23 × 0.85 | 34.13 |
| **32** | 0.89 hours | 1.05 × 0.85 | 62.61 |

**Pricing with Learning Curve:**

**Option 1: Quote Average Cost (Simple):**
- Calculate total hours for entire quantity
- Average = Total hours / Quantity
- Quote based on average cost
- Risk: Early units cost more than quote (lose money initially)
- Benefit: Customer gets consistent price

**Option 2: Quote Actual Cost per Unit (Fair):**
- Quote higher price for first articles
- Reduce price for production quantities
- Reflects actual cost structure
- Requires customer education

**Example Quote with Learning:**
- Qty 1-5: $225 each (covers 2.0 hour first piece)
- Qty 6-20: $175 each (covers ~1.5 hour learning curve)
- Qty 21-50: $150 each (covers ~1.2 hour learning curve)
- Qty 51+: $140 each (covers ~1.0 hour steady state)

## Lead Time Estimation

### Lead Time Components

**Total Lead Time = Material Lead Time + Queue Time + Setup Time + Run Time + Outside Services + Inspection + Buffer**

**Typical Lead Time Breakdown:**

| Component | Percentage of Total | Typical Duration | Variability |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Material Procurement** | 30-50% | 2-12 weeks | High (supplier dependent) |
| **Queue Time (Wait for Machine)** | 20-40% | 1-4 weeks | High (shop load dependent) |
| **Setup + Run Time** | 10-20% | 1-5 days | Low (predictable) |
| **Outside Services** | 15-30% | 1-3 weeks | Medium (process dependent) |
| **Inspection** | 5-10% | 0.5-2 days | Low (predictable) |
| **Buffer/Contingency** | 10-20% | 1-2 weeks | Medium (risk dependent) |

**Lead Time by Part Complexity:**

| Part Type | Material | Manufacturing | Total Lead Time | Assumptions |
|-----------|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Simple (Bar Stock)** | 1-2 weeks | 1-2 weeks | **3-4 weeks** | Standard material, simple turning/milling |
| **Moderate (Plate Stock)** | 2-4 weeks | 2-4 weeks | **5-8 weeks** | Common material, CNC machining, standard anodize |
| **Complex (Forging)** | 8-12 weeks | 3-6 weeks | **12-18 weeks** | Custom forging, multi-axis machining, heat treat |
| **Very Complex (Casting)** | 10-16 weeks | 4-8 weeks | **16-24 weeks** | Investment casting, extensive machining, coating, testing |

### Expedite Options and Costs

**Expediting Strategies:**

| Strategy | Lead Time Reduction | Cost Impact | When to Offer |
|----------|---------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Material Expedite** | 30-50% reduction | +10-20% material cost | Material is critical path |
| **Overtime Production** | 20-40% reduction | +30-50% labor cost | Short-duration expedite (1-2 weeks) |
| **Priority Queue** | 10-30% reduction | +5-15% total cost | Moderate urgency |
| **Dedicated Resource** | 40-60% reduction | +50-100% total cost | Urgent, small quantity |
| **Air Freight** | Depends on location | +100-500% shipping cost | Customer supplied or critical delivery |

**Expedite Pricing Example:**

- **Learning Curve Application:** Factor production learning into multi-piece quotes

**Competitive Pricing:**
- **Market-Based Margins:** Balance competitiveness with profitability (15-25% target margin)
- **Volume Discounts:** Offer quantity breaks to reward larger orders
- **Long-Term Agreements:** Partner pricing for annual contracts and forecasted volumes
- **Value Engineering:** Suggest design modifications to reduce cost during quoting phase

**Quote Turnaround:**
- **Simple Parts:** 24-48 hour quote turnaround
- **Complex Parts:** 3-5 business day turnaround
- **RFQ Packages:** Staggered quotes based on complexity
- **Expedited Quotes:** Same-day quotes available for urgent requests

**Transparency and Communication:**
- **Detailed Breakdown:** Provide cost breakdown when requested (material, labor, overhead)
- **Lead Time Clarity:** Clear communication of lead time components and dependencies
- **Alternative Options:** Present multiple options (material substitutions, finish alternatives, quantity breaks)
- **Design Feedback:** Highlight cost drivers and suggest optimizations

**Quote Accuracy:**
- **±10% Target:** Strive for ±10% accuracy between quote and actual cost on production orders
- **Continuous Improvement:** Review quote vs. actual monthly to refine estimating
- **Risk Contingency:** Include appropriate buffer for unknowns based on information completeness
- **Customer Collaboration:** Request clarification on ambiguous requirements to avoid assumptions
