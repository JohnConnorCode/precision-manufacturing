## Understanding Manufacturing Cost Structure

### Cost Component Breakdown

**Typical Aerospace/Precision Component Cost Structure:**

| Cost Element | Percentage of Total | Optimization Potential | Primary Strategies |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Raw Material** | 20-35% | 10-25% reduction | Material substitution, utilization, volume buying |
| **Direct Labor (Machining)** | 30-45% | 15-35% reduction | Cycle time reduction, setup optimization, automation |
| **Tooling** | 5-15% | 10-30% reduction | Tool life extension, process optimization |

| **Overhead Allocation** | 15-25% | 10-20% reduction | Capacity utilization, batch optimization |

**Example - Aerospace Aluminum Bracket ($100 total cost):**
- Material: $22 (22%)
- Machining labor: $38 (38%)
- Tooling: $8 (8%)
- Setup: $7 (7%)
- Anodizing: $9 (9%)
- Inspection: $6 (6%)
- Overhead: $10 (10%)
- **Total: $100**

**After Optimization (Same Bracket):**
- Material: $18 (18%) - Better utilization, volume discount
- Machining labor: $28 (28%) - Reduced cycle time, optimized toolpath
- Tooling: $6 (6%) - Better speeds/feeds, longer tool life
- Setup: $3 (3%) - Fixture investment amortized over volume
- Anodizing: $9 (9%) - No change (external)
- Inspection: $4 (4%) - In-process monitoring, reduced sampling
- Overhead: $8 (8%) - Better capacity utilization
- **Total: $76 (24% cost reduction)**

### Fixed vs. Variable Costs

Understanding cost behavior with volume is critical for optimization:

**Fixed Costs (Do Not Change with Volume):**
- Setup and programming
- Fixture design and fabrication
- First article inspection
- Process development
- Tooling (partially fixed)

**Variable Costs (Change Proportionally with Volume):**
- Raw material
- Direct labor (machining time)
- Tooling wear (inserts, cutting tools)
- Consumables (coolant, cutting fluid)
- Energy (proportional to run time)

**Semi-Variable Costs (Step Functions):**
- Dedicated fixtures (fixed above certain volume)
- Inspection (sampling frequency reduces percentage at higher volumes)
- Overhead (absorbs better with higher throughput)

**Volume Impact Example - Swiss Machined Pin:**

| Volume | Unit Cost | Cost Breakdown | Optimization Strategy |
|--------|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **10 pieces (Prototype)** | $45.00/pc | Setup $300 + $15/pc variable | Minimize setup complexity, accept higher unit cost |
| **100 pieces** | $18.00/pc | Setup $300 + $15/pc variable | Optimize for lowest total cost |
| **500 pieces** | $11.40/pc | Setup $300 + fixture $200 + $10/pc variable | Invest in fixture, optimize cycle time |
| **5,000 pieces** | $6.85/pc | Setup $300 + fixture $2000 + $8.50/pc variable | Premium fixture, optimized process, volume material pricing |

## Material Cost Optimization

### Material Selection Strategy

**Material Cost Drivers:**
1. Base material price per pound
2. Machinability (cutting speed, tool life)
3. Buy-to-fly ratio (raw stock size vs. finished part)
4. Material form (bar, plate, forging, casting)
5. Availability and lead time (premium for exotic or rush)

**Machinability Cost Impact Analysis:**

Assuming equivalent functional performance, material choice dramatically affects total cost:

| Material | Material $/lb | Machining Cost Factor | Total Cost Index | Weight Factor | Typical Applications |
|----------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Aluminum 6061-T6** | $2.50 | 1.0x (baseline) | 1.0x | 1.0x | General aerospace, excellent machinability |
| **Aluminum 7075-T6** | $3.25 | 1.1x | 1.15x | 1.04x (denser) | High-strength aerospace |
| **Brass 360** | $4.50 | 0.9x (easy) | 1.20x | 3.1x (heavy) | Excellent machinability, heavy |
| **303 Stainless** | $3.50 | 1.5x | 1.70x | 2.9x (heavy) | Corrosion resistance, good machinability |
| **316 Stainless** | $4.25 | 1.8x | 2.05x | 2.9x | Superior corrosion, harder to machine |
| **17-4PH Stainless** | $5.50 | 2.0x | 2.40x | 2.85x | High strength, precipitation hardening |
| **Ti-6Al-4V** | $22.00 | 3.5x | 4.50x | 1.63x | Aerospace, high strength-to-weight, difficult machining |
| **Inconel 718** | $35.00 | 6.0x | 8.20x | 3.0x | High-temperature, extremely difficult machining |

**Material Substitution Case Study:**

**Original Spec:** Inconel 718 aerospace bracket
- Part weight: 0.45 lb finished
- Material cost: 1.2 lb stock × $35/lb = $42
- Machining: 4.5 hours × $95/hr = $427
- Heat treatment: $85
- **Total: $554 per part**

**Functional Analysis Results:**
- Temperature requirement: 400°F maximum
- Corrosion: Moderate (interior aircraft)
- Strength: 150 ksi yield minimum

**Optimized Material:** Ti-6Al-4V (meets all requirements)
- Part weight: 0.38 lb finished
- Material cost: 0.85 lb stock × $25/lb = $21
- Machining: 3.0 hours × $95/hr = $285
- Heat treatment: $45
- **Total: $351 per part**
- **Savings: $203 per part (37% reduction)**

**Key Insight:** Inconel specified by habit ("aerospace = superalloy"). Functional analysis showed Ti-6Al-4V meets all requirements with easier machining and lower cost.

### Material Utilization Optimization

**Buy-to-Fly Ratio:**
The ratio of raw material weight to finished part weight. Lower is better.

**Aerospace Industry Benchmarks:**
- Conventional machining: 5:1 to 20:1 typical (80-95% waste)
- Near-net shape (forging/casting): 1.5:1 to 3:1 (33-50% waste)
- Additive manufacturing: 1.1:1 to 1.3:1 (10-23% waste)

**Material Utilization Strategies:**

| Strategy | Application | Savings Potential | Investment Required |
|----------|-------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Optimized nesting** | Plate stock parts | 10-25% material savings | Programming time only |
| **Standard stock sizes** | Bar stock utilization | 5-15% savings | Design standardization |
| **Near-net castings** | High volume (>500 pieces) | 40-60% material savings | Tooling $5K-50K |
| **Near-net forgings** | High volume, high strength | 50-70% material savings | Tooling $10K-100K |
| **Additive manufacturing** | Complex geometry, low volume | 60-80% material savings | Equipment investment or outsource |

**Material Utilization Example - Rectangular Bracket:**

**Poor Utilization:**
- Finished part: 3.25" × 4.75" × 0.625" = 9.6 cu.in.
- Stock required: 4" × 5.5" × 0.75" plate = 16.5 cu.in.
- Buy-to-fly: 16.5 / 9.6 = 1.72:1
- Material waste: 42%
- 7075-T6 aluminum: 16.5 cu.in. × 0.101 lb/cu.in. × $3.25/lb = $5.41

**Optimized Utilization:**
- Finished part: Same 9.6 cu.in.
- Stock required: 3.5" × 5.0" × 0.625" plate = 10.9 cu.in.
- Buy-to-fly: 10.9 / 9.6 = 1.14:1
- Material waste: 14%
- Material cost: 10.9 cu.in. × 0.101 lb/cu.in. × $3.25/lb = $3.58
- **Savings: $1.83 per part (34% material cost reduction)**

**Implementation:** Design engineer specifies tighter envelope (3.375" × 4.875" vs. 4" × 5.5" raw), allowing smaller stock size.

### Volume Purchasing Strategies

**Material Price Breaks by Volume:**

| Purchase Quantity | Price per Pound | Price Index | Best Application |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Retail (<25 lb)** | $5.50/lb | 1.0x (100%) | Prototype, one-offs |
| **Small batch (25-100 lb)** | $4.40/lb | 0.80x (80%) | Small production runs |
| **Production (100-500 lb)** | $3.85/lb | 0.70x (70%) | Regular production |
| **Volume (500-2000 lb)** | $3.30/lb | 0.60x (60%) | High volume, annual contracts |
| **Contract (>2000 lb annual)** | $2.75/lb | 0.50x (50%) | Strategic supplier relationships |

**Example: 7075-T6 Aluminum Pricing (Actual Market Data)**

**Volume Purchase Strategy:**
- Annual usage: 1,250 lb across multiple parts
- **Option 1:** Buy as-needed in small quantities
  - Average cost: $4.40/lb × 1,250 lb = $5,500 per year
- **Option 2:** Annual contract for 1,500 lb (20% buffer)
  - Contract cost: $2.85/lb × 1,500 lb = $4,275 per year
  - Excess inventory: 250 lb × $2.85 = $712 (still usable, 5 year shelf life)
  - Net savings: $5,500 - $4,275 = $1,225 per year (22% reduction)
  - **ROI: Annual contract saves $1,225 with minimal risk (excess material usable)**

## Tolerance and Quality Cost Optimization

### Tolerance Cost Relationship

**The Tolerance Cost Curve:**

Tightening tolerances beyond functional requirements increases costs exponentially:

| Tolerance Level | Process Required | Inspection | Cost Multiplier vs. ±0.010" | Lead Time Impact |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **±0.010" (±0.25mm)** | Standard 3-axis CNC | Calipers/micrometers | 1.0x (baseline) | Standard |
| **±0.005" (±0.13mm)** | CNC with attention | Digital micrometers | 1.3x | +0-1 day |
| **±0.002" (±0.05mm)** | Precision CNC, temp control | Height gages/CMM | 1.8x | +1-2 days |
| **±0.001" (±0.025mm)** | Precision CNC, CMM verify | CMM 100% | 2.5x | +2-3 days |
| **±0.0005" (±0.013mm)** | Grinding | CMM 100% | 4.0x | +3-5 days |
| **±0.0002" (±0.005mm)** | Precision grinding | CMM with climate control | 7.0x | +5-7 days |
| **±0.0001" (±0.0025mm)** | Ultra-precision grinding | CMM, climate lab | 12.0x | +7-10 days |

**Tolerance Optimization Process:**

1. **Functional Analysis:** What tolerance is actually required for fit, form, and function?
2. **Critical Feature Identification:** Which dimensions are truly critical (typically 10-20%)?
3. **Tolerance Assignment:** Assign loosest tolerance that meets functional requirements
4. **Documentation:** Use GD&T to specify functional requirements, not arbitrary dimensions
5. **Supplier Engagement:** Discuss tolerance requirements early in design phase

**Real-World Example - Aerospace Housing:**

**Original Design (Over-Toleranced):**
- 64 dimensions on drawing
- 52 dimensions specified ±0.002"
- 12 dimensions specified ±0.001"
- Estimated manufacturing cost: $1,285

**After Tolerance Analysis:**
- Same 64 dimensions
- 38 dimensions relaxed to ±0.010" (general tolerance)
- 18 dimensions remain ±0.002" (interface features)
- 8 dimensions remain ±0.001" (critical mating surfaces)
- **Actual manufacturing cost: $795**
- **Savings: $490 per part (38% reduction)**

**Process Changes:**
- Reduced CMM inspection time from 2.5 hours to 45 minutes
- Eliminated secondary grinding on 12 features
- Reduced precision machining operations from 18 to 8
- Zero functional impact - all parts met assembly and performance requirements

### Quality Cost Analysis

**Cost of Quality Framework:**

| Quality Cost Category | Percentage of Total | Optimization Opportunity |

- Production: In-process monitoring of critical dimensions only
- CMM sampling: 1 in 25 parts (reduced from 100%)
- Inspection time per part average: 6 minutes
- **Total inspection cost: $13,200 per year**
- **Savings: $31,800 per year (71% reduction)**
- **Quality level: Maintained or improved through SPC monitoring**

## Process Optimization Strategies

### Cycle Time Reduction

**Machining Cycle Time Breakdown:**

**Cycle Time Optimization Example:**

**Baseline Process - Aerospace Fitting (7075 Aluminum):**
- Cycle time: 28.5 minutes
  - Air time (rapids): 4.2 minutes
  - Roughing cuts: 9.8 minutes
  - Finishing cuts: 8.5 minutes
  - Tool changes: 3.5 minutes (8 tools)
  - In-cycle probing: 2.5 minutes (4 probe cycles)

**Optimized Process:**
- Cycle time: 17.8 minutes (38% reduction)
  - Air time: 2.8 minutes (optimized tool paths, reduced rapids)
  - Roughing cuts: 7.2 minutes (adaptive clearing, higher material removal rates)
  - Finishing cuts: 5.5 minutes (optimized speeds/feeds, better inserts)
  - Tool changes: 1.5 minutes (6 tools, combined operations)
  - In-cycle probing: 0.8 minutes (2 probe cycles, post-setup only)

**Cost Impact (1,000 piece annual volume):**
- Machine rate: $95/hour
- Baseline: 28.5 min × 1,000 pcs = 475 hours × $95 = $45,125
- Optimized: 17.8 min × 1,000 pcs = 297 hours × $95 = $28,215
- **Annual savings: $16,910 (37% reduction)**
- **Programming investment: 12 hours × $85/hour = $1,020**
- **ROI: 16.6:1 in first year, recurring savings every year**

### Tooling Optimization

**Tool Life Extension Strategies:**

| Strategy | Investment | Tool Life Improvement | Cost Reduction | Applications |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Premium coated inserts** | +30-50% tool cost | 2-3× longer life | 40-60% lower tool cost per part | Stainless, titanium, difficult materials |
| **Optimized speeds/feeds** | Programming time only | 1.5-2× longer life | 25-40% | All materials |
| **High-pressure coolant** | $5K-15K system upgrade | 2-4× longer life | 50-75% | Titanium, Inconel, deep holes |
| **Micro-lubrication (MQL)** | $3K-8K system | 1.5-2× life vs. flood coolant | 30-50% | Aluminum, some steels |
| **Tool presetting** | $8K-25K presetter | Consistent tool life, less variance | 15-25% | High-precision operations |

**Tooling Cost Example - Titanium Part:**

**Baseline Tooling Approach:**
- Material: Ti-6Al-4V, complex aerospace bracket
- Cutting speed: 150 SFM (conservative)
- Carbide inserts: Standard grade, no coating
- Tool life: 15 minutes per cutting edge
- Tools per part: 0.6 edges (25 minute cycle time)
- Insert cost: $12 per edge
- **Tooling cost per part: $12 × 0.6 = $7.20**

**Optimized Tooling:**
- Same material and part
- Cutting speed: 200 SFM (more aggressive, still safe)
- Premium TiAlN-coated carbide inserts
- Tool life: 50 minutes per cutting edge (3.3× improvement)
- Cycle time reduced: 19 minutes (24% faster)
- Tools per part: 0.38 edges
- Insert cost: $18 per edge (+50% cost, but 3.3× life)
- **Tooling cost per part: $18 × 0.38 = $6.84**
- **Combined savings: $0.36 tooling + $7.60 cycle time = $7.96 per part**

**Annual Volume: 500 pieces**
- Total savings: $7.96 × 500 = $3,980
- Insert investment premium: $18-$12 = $6 × 190 edges = $1,140
- **Net first year savings: $2,840**
- **Subsequent years: Full $3,980 savings**

### Setup Reduction Strategies

**Setup Time Impact on Cost:**

Setup costs are amortized over production quantity, dramatically affecting low-volume economics:

| Setup Time | 10 Pieces | 100 Pieces | 500 Pieces | 5,000 Pieces |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **4 hours ($95/hr) = $380** | $38.00/pc | $3.80/pc | $0.76/pc | $0.08/pc |
| **2 hours (50% reduction)** | $19.00/pc | $1.90/pc | $0.38/pc | $0.04/pc |
| **1 hour (75% reduction)** | $9.50/pc | $0.95/pc | $0.19/pc | $0.02/pc |

**Setup Reduction Techniques:**

| Technique | Investment | Setup Time Reduction | Best Volume Range |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Standardized fixturing** | $5K-20K per family | 40-60% | All volumes |
| **Quick-change tooling** | $2K-10K | 30-50% | Medium-high volume |
| **Preset tools** | $8K-25K presetter | 25-40% | High volume |
| **Cell-based manufacturing** | $20K-100K | 50-75% | Very high volume |
| **SMED methodology** | Training only ($2K-5K) | 30-60% | All volumes |

**Setup Reduction Case Study:**

**Baseline Setup - Aerospace Bracket Family (6 similar parts):**
- Setup time per job: 3.5 hours
- Activities: Locate fixtures, indicate workpiece, load tools, prove out program, first article
- Annual jobs: 24 (6 parts × 4 runs per year)
- **Total setup time: 84 hours per year = $7,980 (at $95/hour)**

**After Setup Reduction Implementation:**
- Investment: Dedicated fixture system with preset locations ($8,500)
- Training: SMED workshop for operators ($2,800)
- New setup time: 1.2 hours (66% reduction)
- Activities streamlined: Quick-change fixtures, preset tools, reduced prove-out
- **Total setup time: 28.8 hours per year = $2,736**
- **Annual savings: $5,244**
- **Payback period: 11,300 / 5,244 = 2.2 years**
- **5-year ROI: $26,220 savings - $11,300 investment = $14,920 net (232% return)**

## Volume-Based Optimization Strategies

### Lot Size Optimization

**Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Principles:**

Balancing setup costs against inventory holding costs to find optimal production quantity.

**Lot Sizing Factors:**

| Factor | Impact on Optimal Lot Size |
|--------|---------------------------|
| **Setup cost** | Higher setup → larger lots (amortize fixed cost) |
| **Inventory carrying cost** | Higher carrying cost → smaller lots (less inventory) |
| **Annual demand** | Higher demand → larger lots (economies of scale) |
| **Lead time** | Longer lead time → larger lots (buffer against variability) |
| **Shelf life** | Limited shelf life → smaller lots (prevent obsolescence) |

**Lot Size Optimization Example:**

**Part Details:**
- Annual demand: 2,400 pieces (200 per month average)
- Setup cost: $450 per run
- Unit manufacturing cost: $35
- Inventory carrying cost: 20% of unit cost per year = $7/unit/year
- Current practice: Run monthly (200 pieces per lot)

**Current Cost Structure:**
- Setup costs: 12 runs × $450 = $5,400 per year
- Average inventory: 100 pieces (half lot size)
- Inventory carrying cost: 100 × $7 = $700 per year
- **Total: $6,100 per year**

**EOQ Calculation:**
- EOQ = √(2 × Annual Demand × Setup Cost / Carrying Cost)
- EOQ = √(2 × 2,400 × $450 / $7) = √(308,571) = 555 pieces

**Optimized Lot Size: 600 pieces (round up for practicality)**
- Number of runs: 2,400 / 600 = 4 runs per year
- Setup costs: 4 × $450 = $1,800
- Average inventory: 300 pieces
- Inventory carrying cost: 300 × $7 = $2,100
- **Total: $3,900 per year**
- **Savings: $2,200 per year (36% reduction)**

**Considerations:**
- Storage space available? (300 avg vs. 100 avg inventory)
- Demand stability? (more predictable = larger lots safer)
- Customer flexibility? (can they accept quarterly deliveries vs. monthly?)

### Process Consolidation

**Multi-Operation Consolidation Benefits:**

Combining multiple operations or setups into single process:

**Example - Complex Fitting (Before Consolidation):**
- Operation 1: 3-axis mill top features (Setup 1)
- Operation 2: Flip, 3-axis mill bottom features (Setup 2)
- Operation 3: Wire EDM internal slots (Setup 3, outsource)
- Operation 4: Deburr and edge break (Manual operation)
- Total lead time: 14 days
- Total cost: $485 per part

**After Consolidation (5-Axis CNC):**
- Single operation: 5-axis machine all features in one setup
- EDM eliminated through design modification (approved by customer)
- Edge breaks machined in-process (chamfer mill)
- Total lead time: 6 days
- Total cost: $295 per part
- **Savings: $190 per part (39% reduction), 8 days faster**

**Consolidation Investment:**
- 5-axis machine investment: $450,000 (or use existing if available)
- Fixture design: $4,500
- Programming: 40 hours × $85 = $3,400
- Process development: $2,800
- **Total investment: $10,700 (excluding machine)**

**ROI Analysis (Annual Volume: 250 pieces):**
- Annual savings: $190 × 250 = $47,500
- Payback: $10,700 / $47,500 = 0.23 years (2.7 months)
- **5-year return: $237,500 - $10,700 = $226,800**

### Supplier Relationship Optimization

**Strategic Supplier Partnership Benefits:**

| Partnership Level | Characteristics | Cost Benefits | Risk |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|------|
| **Transactional** | Quote-by-quote, multiple suppliers | No commitment, competitive pricing | Price volatility, quality variance |
| **Preferred Supplier** | 60-80% of spend, informal relationship | 5-10% cost reduction vs. transactional | Moderate dependency |
| **Strategic Partner** | 90%+ of spend, long-term agreement | 15-25% cost reduction, shared innovation | High dependency, requires trust |

**Strategic Partnership Value Creation:**

| Value Element | Mechanism | Typical Savings |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Volume commitment** | Annual contracts with volume guarantee | 8-15% price reduction |
| **Reduced quote overhead** | Blanket POs, fewer quotes per year | 3-5% admin cost reduction |
| **Joint process development** | Supplier invests in process optimization | 10-20% efficiency gains |
| **Inventory management** | Supplier holds buffer stock | 5-10% inventory carrying cost reduction |
| **Quality improvement** | Shared quality data, continuous improvement | 30-50% reduction in defects |
| **Design collaboration** | Early supplier involvement in design | 20-40% design cost optimization |

**Partnership Case Study:**

**Baseline (Transactional Relationship):**
- Annual spending: $425,000 across 47 part numbers
- Suppliers: 5 different machine shops, quote each job
