## The One Blocker (5-Minute Fix)

### Issue
The `SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN` in `.env.local` lacks the "create" permission scope. This prevents programmatic document creation via API.

### Error
```
Insufficient permissions; permission "create" required
```

### What It Affects
- ‚ùå Cannot run migration scripts
- ‚úÖ Everything else is ready

### What It Doesn't Affect
- ‚úÖ Page components work fine
- ‚úÖ Query functions are ready
- ‚úÖ Error handling works (shows "Service Not Found")
- ‚úÖ Sanity Studio can still create documents (has full permissions)

### How to Fix (2 Minutes)

1. Go to **https://manage.sanity.io**
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API & Webhooks** ‚Üí **Tokens**
4. Edit `SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN` (or create new one)
5. Enable these scopes:
   - ‚úì Create
   - ‚úì Read
   - ‚úì Update
   - ‚úì Delete
6. Copy the updated token value
7. Update in `.env.local`
8. Restart dev server

**Detailed guide**: See `/docs/SANITY_TOKEN_SETUP.md`

```

### Start Phase 2 (4-5 hours)
