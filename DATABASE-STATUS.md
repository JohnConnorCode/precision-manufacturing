## Issues & Action Items

### 1. Fix Untitled Industry ⚠️
**Priority:** Medium
**Action:** Use Payload admin panel to either:
- Complete the industry entry (add title, slug, content), OR
- Delete the incomplete entry

**How to fix:**
1. Go to `/admin`
2. Navigate to Industries collection
3. Find the "Untitled" entry
4. Either complete it or delete it

### 2. Verify UI Text Global ⚠️
**Priority:** Low
**Action:** Confirm if `ui-text` global exists and is populated

**How to verify:**
1. Check admin panel globals section
2. If missing, run seed script again or create manually
3. Verify button text and section headings display correctly on site

### 3. Update Seed Script Documentation ℹ️
**Priority:** Low
**Action:** Document the actual collection names vs configured slugs:
- Config: `site-settings` → Database: `settings`
- Config: `homepage` → Database: `homepage` ✓
- Config: `ui-text` → Database: Unknown
