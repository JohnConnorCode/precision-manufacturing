## How Changes Deploy

1. **Edit** content in GitHub or admin UI
2. **Commit** changes (automatic via Git)
3. **Push** to main branch
4. **Vercel** detects change
5. **Auto-rebuild** in ~2-3 minutes
6. **Live** on your domain

---

## What NOT to Change

⚠️ **Don't Edit These**:
- File names (will break URLs)
- `slug` fields (unless you update URLs too)
- YAML structure (syntax errors break pages)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Page shows "Service Not Found"
- Check the slug matches the URL
- Verify YAML frontmatter is valid
- Ensure file is `.mdx` not `.md`

### Images don't load
- Check path starts with `/uploads/`
- Verify file exists in `/public/uploads/`
- Try refreshing the page

### Changes don't appear
- Wait 2-3 minutes for Vercel rebuild
- Check if commit was successful
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)

### YAML syntax error
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Quote string values with special characters
- Avoid tabs (use spaces only)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Configure Tina Cloud** (optional, for visual editor):
   - Sign up at https://tina.io
   - Create a new project
   - Add `TINA_CLIENT_ID` and `TINA_TOKEN` to `.env`

2. **Train marketing team**:
   - Show them how to edit files in GitHub
   - Explain YAML frontmatter
   - Demonstrate commit/push workflow

3. **Add more content**:
   - Create pages for About, Contact, Careers
   - Follow same `.mdx` format
   - Link from navigation

4. **Optimize images**:
   - Resize to 1200x800px before upload
   - Use compressed JPG/PNG
   - Verify they display well

## Support

- **Edit locally**: VS Code with MDX extension
- **Edit online**: GitHub web interface
