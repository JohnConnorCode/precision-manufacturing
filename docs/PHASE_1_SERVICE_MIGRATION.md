## Fallback: Keeping Hardcoded Pages

The existing hardcoded service pages will continue to work:
- `/services/5-axis-machining/page.tsx` (hardcoded)
- `/services/adaptive-machining/page.tsx` (hardcoded)
- `/services/engineering/page.tsx` (hardcoded)
- `/services/metrology/page.tsx` (hardcoded)

Once Sanity documents are published, you can either:
1. Delete the hardcoded pages (Sanity will take over)
2. Keep them as fallbacks (NextJS will route to most specific match)

## Performance Notes

**ISR Revalidation:**
- Published services: Revalidate every 60 seconds
- Draft services: No caching (real-time updates in preview mode)
- Slug list: Revalidate every hour (for static generation)

**Caching:**
- Images: Optimized via Sanity CDN
- Content: ISR ensures fresh data within 60s of changes
- Preview: Real-time (no caching) for editor feedback

## Troubleshooting

**Service page shows "Service Not Found"**
- Verify Sanity document is published (not draft)
- Check slug matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Clear browser cache
- Revalidate ISR: Request page after 60 seconds

**Images not loading**
- Verify image is uploaded to Sanity
- Check image field is filled in service document
- Verify image format is supported

**Preview mode not working**
- Verify PREVIEW_SECRET_TOKEN is set correctly
- Check SANITY_READ_TOKEN is configured
- Verify draftClient has perspective: 'previewDrafts'

**Build errors**
- Run `npm run build` to verify
- Check TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Clear `.next` folder and rebuild

## Next Steps

Once all 4 services are in Sanity and tested:
1. Delete hardcoded service page components (optional)
2. Verify static generation works: `npm run build`
3. Test all 4 services on production
4. Proceed to Phase 2: Industry Pages Migration
