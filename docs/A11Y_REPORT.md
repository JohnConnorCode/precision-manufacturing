Lighthouse Accessibility: 98/100
```

### Manual Testing

#### Keyboard Navigation
- ✅ All interactive elements reachable
- ✅ Tab order follows visual flow
- ✅ Focus indicators visible
- ✅ Dropdown menus navigable
- ✅ Modal dialogs trap focus appropriately

#### Screen Reader Testing

- ✅ VoiceOver (macOS): Full compatibility
- ✅ VoiceOver (iOS): Full compatibility
- ⚠️ TalkBack (Android): Minor navigation quirks in mega menu

#### Color & Contrast
- ✅ Text contrast: Minimum 4.5:1

- ✅ Error states don't rely on color alone

### Responsive & Touch

- ✅ Orientation works in portrait/landscape
- ✅ Gestures have alternatives

## Remaining Accessibility Risks

### Low Priority
1. **Complex Data Tables** (if added)
   - Will need proper headers and captions
   - Consider responsive alternatives

2. **Video Content** (future)
   - Will require captions and transcripts
   - Audio descriptions for visual content

3. **PDF Documents**
   - Supplier requirements PDF needs tagging
   - Alternative HTML version provided

### Monitoring Required
1. **Dynamic Content**
   - Live regions for status updates
   - Announcement of form validation

2. **Third-party Widgets**
   - Sanity Studio accessibility
   - Analytics scripts impact

## Assistive Technology Support

### Tested With
- **Screen Readers**: JAWS 2023, NVDA 2023, VoiceOver
- **Browsers**: Chrome 120, Firefox 121, Safari 17, Edge 120
- **Devices**: Desktop, tablet, mobile
- **Input Methods**: Keyboard, touch, mouse, voice

### Known Limitations
1. Sanity Studio requires mouse for some operations
2. Complex animations may cause issues with older screen readers
3. Some browser/screen reader combinations have minor quirks

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Developers
```jsx
// Always include ARIA labels
<button aria-label="Close dialog">×</button>

// Use semantic HTML
<nav> instead of <div role="navigation">

// Provide text alternatives
<img src="chart.jpg" alt="Production capacity chart showing 40% growth">

// Handle focus management
const trapFocus = (element) => {
  const focusableElements = element.querySelectorAll(
    'a, button, input, textarea, select, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])'
  );
  // Implementation...
};
```

### For Content Editors
1. Always add alt text to images
2. Use proper heading hierarchy
3. Write descriptive link text (not "click here")
4. Ensure sufficient color contrast
5. Keep language simple and clear
