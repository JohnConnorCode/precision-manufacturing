# Phase 1: Critical Blocker Report

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: ⚠️ **BLOCKED** - Waiting for Sanity API Token Configuration
**Blocker Type**: External Configuration (Sanity Console)
**Impact**: Cannot programmatically populate 4 service documents until resolved

---

## Summary

Phase 1 infrastructure is **100% complete**. All code, templates, and scripts are ready. The only blocker is a Sanity API token configuration issue that requires manual intervention in the Sanity Console.

### What's Complete ✅
- [x] Sanity schema comprehensive and verified
- [x] Draft preview mode infrastructure configured
- [x] Service query functions created and tested
- [x] Dynamic service page template built (498 lines, fully featured)
- [x] Migration scripts prepared and ready
- [x] All 4 service documents pre-configured in JSON format
- [x] Comprehensive documentation and guides created
- [x] Dev server running and responsive

### What's Blocked ⚠️
- [ ] Populate 4 service documents in Sanity (requires token permission fix)
- [ ] Test service pages end-to-end
- [ ] Enable ISR revalidation

---

## The Blocker Explained

### Issue
The `SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN` in `.env.local` lacks "create" permission scope.

### Error Messages
```
Insufficient permissions; permission "create" required
```

### Why It Matters
The token can read and update data but cannot create new documents. This affects:
- ❌ Programmatic document creation via API
- ❌ Sanity CLI document import
- ❌ Migration scripts execution
- ✅ Manual document creation in Sanity Studio (UI has full permissions)
- ✅ Reading/updating existing documents

### Root Cause
Token permissions are configured in Sanity Console (`https://manage.sanity.io`) and don't include "create" scope.

---

## Solution: 2 Options

### Option 1: Update Token in Sanity Console (2 minutes)
**Recommended** - Most straightforward

1. Open **https://manage.sanity.io**
2. Select project → **Settings** → **API & Webhooks** → **Tokens**
3. Edit `SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN` or create new one
4. Enable scopes:
   - ✓ Create
   - ✓ Read
   - ✓ Update
   - ✓ Delete
5. Copy new token
6. Update `.env.local`
7. Restart dev server
8. Run: `node scripts/create-services-with-ids.mjs`

### Option 2: Manually Create Documents in Studio UI (10 minutes)
**Fallback** - If token update fails

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/studio`
2. Click "Service Pages" → "Create new"
3. Enter basic info for each service:
   - Title
   - Slug
   - Service Category
   - Content Status: Published
4. Save each
5. Script-populate additional fields later

## What Each Script Does

### `create-services-with-ids.mjs` ⭐ PRIMARY
**Status**: Ready to execute (waiting for token fix)

```bash
node scripts/create-services-with-ids.mjs
```

**Features**:
- Reads `/scripts/services-to-create.json`
- Creates documents with explicit IDs (`service-5-axis-machining`, etc.)
- Handles create/update scenarios
- Graceful error handling
- Detailed console output

**Expected Output**:
```
Creating 4 services with explicit IDs...
✅ Created: 5-Axis Machining (service-5-axis-machining)
✅ Created: Adaptive Machining (service-adaptive-machining)
✅ Created: Metrology Services (service-metrology)
✅ Created: Engineering Services (service-engineering)

✨ Service creation/update complete!
```

### `migrate-services.mjs` - ALTERNATIVE
Similar to above, auto-generates document IDs

### Sanity CLI Method - ALTERNATIVE
```bash
npx sanity documents create scripts/services-to-create.json --replace
```

Requires `sanity login` first (interactive)

## Testing Plan (Ready to Execute)

Once token is fixed:

```bash
# 1. Run migration
node scripts/create-services-with-ids.mjs

# 2. Start dev server (if not already running)
npm run dev

# 3. Test each service page
curl -s http://localhost:3000/services/5-axis-machining | grep "5-Axis"
curl -s http://localhost:3000/services/adaptive-machining | grep "Adaptive"
curl -s http://localhost:3000/services/metrology | grep "Metrology"
curl -s http://localhost:3000/services/engineering | grep "Engineering"

# 4. Verify no console errors
# Visit: http://localhost:3000/services/5-axis-machining in browser

# 5. Test draft preview mode
http://localhost:3000/api/preview?secret=YOUR_SECRET&slug=5-axis-machining&type=service

# 6. Run test suite
npm test

# 7. Build verification
npm run build
```

## Timeline

### Completed (Days 1-4)
- Infrastructure design and planning
- Schema creation and validation
- Query functions development
- Dynamic page component (498 lines)
- Migration scripts development
- Comprehensive documentation
- Data preparation (4 services, fully specified)

### Blocked (Waiting for Token Fix)
- Service document creation: **2 minutes execution time**
- Page testing: **5 minutes**
- Build verification: **2 minutes**

### After Token Fix
- Total execution time: **~10 minutes**
- All 4 pages should render and be fully functional

---

## Impact Analysis

### If Token is Fixed Today
✅ Phase 1 completes today
✅ Can start Phase 2 immediately
✅ Full CMS-managed service pages

### If Token is NOT Fixed
⚠️ Phase 1 blocked until token permission is updated
⚠️ Phase 2+ cannot start
⚠️ Phase 1 partial completion: 95% infrastructure, 0% data
