## Implementation Strategy
1. **Within-Series Links**: Sequential navigation (Part 1 → Part 2 → Part 3, etc.)
2. **Cross-Series Links**: Topically related content that supports the main topic
3. **Foundation Links**: Link advanced topics to foundational concepts
4. **Application Links**: Link theoretical concepts to practical applications
