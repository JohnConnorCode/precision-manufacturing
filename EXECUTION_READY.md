## What Happens When Token Is Fixed

### IMMEDIATELY (Automatic)

I will execute in sequence:

#### 1. **Phase 1 Migration** (30 seconds)
```bash
node scripts/create-services-with-ids.mjs
```

Creates these documents in Sanity:
- ✅ 5-Axis Machining (`service-5-axis-machining`)
- ✅ Adaptive Machining (`service-adaptive-machining`)
- ✅ Metrology Services (`service-metrology`)
- ✅ Engineering Services (`service-engineering`)

#### 2. **Phase 1 Verification** (5 minutes)
Test that all 4 service pages render:
- http://localhost:3000/services/5-axis-machining
- http://localhost:3000/services/adaptive-machining
- http://localhost:3000/services/metrology
- http://localhost:3000/services/engineering

Each page will:
- ✅ Display content from Sanity CMS
- ✅ Show related services (auto-linked)
- ✅ Render with animations
- ✅ Have SEO metadata

#### 3. **Phase 1 Commit** (1 minute)
```bash
git commit -m "Phase 1: Service pages CMS-managed"
```

#### 4. **Phase 2 Migration** (30 seconds)
```bash
node scripts/create-industries-with-ids.mjs
```

Creates these documents in Sanity:
- ✅ Aerospace Manufacturing (`industry-aerospace`)
- ✅ Defense & Precision Engineering (`industry-defense`)
- ✅ Energy & Power Generation (`industry-energy`)
- ✅ Medical Device Manufacturing (`industry-medical`)

#### 5. **Phase 2 Verification** (5 minutes)
Test that all 4 industry pages render:
- http://localhost:3000/industries/aerospace
- http://localhost:3000/industries/defense
- http://localhost:3000/industries/energy
- http://localhost:3000/industries/medical

Each page will:
- ✅ Display content from Sanity CMS
- ✅ Show regulatory info & certifications
- ✅ Display use cases & applications
- ✅ Show related industries

#### 6. **Industries Hub Update** (automatic)
The industries hub page at `/industries` will now:
- ✅ Fetch all industries from Sanity
- ✅ Display live data from CMS
- ✅ Show accurate certifications
- ✅ Link to all dynamic industry pages

#### 7. **Phase 2 Commit** (1 minute)
```bash
git commit -m "Phase 2: Industry pages CMS-managed"
```

#### 8. **Build Verification** (2 minutes)
```bash
npm run build
```

Ensure everything compiles without errors.
